This year’s Nordic Game Jam was crowned as the world’s largest game jam with about 470 participants. The winners have been announced, and can see the full list here: [http://nordicgamejam.org/2013/01/21/winners-ngj13/](http://nordicgamejam.org/2013/01/21/winners-ngj13/)

My personal highlight goes to Stalagflight ([https://dl.dropbox.com/u/85666/Stalagflight-web/webBuild.html](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/85666/Stalagflight-web/webBuild.html)), which is as simple as stupidly fun! Stalagflight can be played with the keyboard, but it is tricky. If you have a gamepad the experience is much better.
