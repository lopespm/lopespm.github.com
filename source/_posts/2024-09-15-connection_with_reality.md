As we experience an increase of massive amounts of AI generated content, this note will go through the role and added value that a connection with reality and nature brings not only to your business and craft, but also to yourself.

## Striking a balance

Walking or hiking has been a recurrent weekly habit of mine for several years, and its one of my favorite activities.

I find it essential to have a walk outside the office / home and be in contact with the surrounding world, be it in nature or around the city. This is especially relevant for those, like me, who have their daily jobs working at the computer.

I love to be enthralled in the digital world, think about abstract concepts, and use digital devices to, for example, communicate this content to you. But like anything else, a balance needs to be kept, and a balance between the digital and real domains seems essential.

## The added value of (connecting with) reality

As generative models get better, more and more people will just assume that a given piece of text, image or video is likely fake, and I believe there will be an increased demand for a connection with the real world through experiences such as in-person events, travel, spirituality, or consumption of digital content by certified entities.

Businesses and creators that prove their connection with the real world and real people, will likely have an edge and rise against the noise.

So if you're creating a business, a piece of content, anything really, think how it relates with the real world. Ask yourself: how can you provide that connection? How can you provide _reality as a service_?

## Keep yourself connected with reality

Apart from all this, and just as important, it's for _you_ to maintain _your_ contact with reality.

So if you feel you spend too much time around the internet, digital devices, TV series, etc, I invite you to the outdoors, the world outside. It's free, it's accessible. You just need to open the door and step out, provided you are fortunate enough to have the required physical capabilities. I'm pretty sure that it will make your life much better.
