    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After several years using Evernote, I’ve eventually migrated all my notes into Obsidian, which allowed me to have full control of my notes, in a format that I could use, move, or <a href="/machine_learning/2024/06/24/personal-llm.html">leverage upon</a>. As a consequence, my notes would no longer live in the cloud and my personal device, so any redundancy and backups would need to be guaranteed by me, via my personal periodic backups.</p>

<p>Having more than a decade’s worth of notes relying on a single redundancy made me somewhat uneasy, so the options I could think of were either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Subscribe to <a href="https://obsidian.md/sync">Obsidian’s Sync service</a>, which would recurrently cost $4 every month, <em>every month</em>. My encrypted notes would be tethered to Obsidian’s cloud service</li>
  <li>Have a custom solution that leverage’s Obsidian’s outstanding customizability, compress and encrypt all my notes, and use a cloud service to host this archive. I would have the flexibility to choose any cloud provider I would desire.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve chosen option 2., using the Google Drive cloud service, and in this note will share how you can too.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h1>

<p>The idea is simple: use the <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=obsidian-shellcommands">obsidian-shellcommands</a> shell plugin to run a custom script, whenever Obsidian quits (this event is configurable, but I find the application).</p>

<h2 id="step-1-custom-script-that-encrypts-and-backs-up-all-notes">Step 1. Custom script that encrypts and backs up all notes</h2>

<p>First, save the below script into a folder in your computer (for example, at <code>/Users/yourunixname/backups/my_backup_script.sh</code>), and update it with your own Obsidian, backup destination folders and your own archive password:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/zsh

obsidian_notes_folder=&quot;&lt;your_obsidian_folder&gt;&quot; ; # For example, /Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/obsidian
obsidian_notes_tar_archive=&quot;${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_backup.tar.gz&quot; ;
backup_folder=&quot;&lt;folder_where_the_final_encrypted_backup_will_be_placed&gt;&quot;; # For example, /Users/yourusername/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive/MyDrive/backup_folder

echo &quot;Starting to compress obsidian notes...&quot; ;

# Create a .tar archive that contains all the contents inside the obsidian folder
tar -czf ${obsidian_notes_tar_archive} ${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_backup

# Compress the .tar archive into an encrypted .7z with password &quot;PasswordOfYourChoosing&quot;
# In this example, 7za installed from the nix package manager is used
/Users/yourusername/.nix-profile/bin/7za a -tzip -mem=AES256 -mx=0 -mmt=12 -pPasswordOfYourChoosing ${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_backup.7z ${obsidian_notes_tar_archive} ;

# Move the .7z file into the the backup folder (e.g. your Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive folder)
mv ${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_pedrolopes_nodes_backup.7z ${backup_folder}/obsidian_backup.7z ;

echo &quot;Finished compressing and moving to backup folder&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The comments are mostly self-explanatory, but essentially this is what the script does:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First create a .tar archive that contains all the contents inside the obsidian folder</li>
  <li>Compresses the .tar archive into a password encrypted <code>.7z</code> file. Remember to update the password with your own private password</li>
  <li>Moves the <code>.7z</code> file into the destination folder, which could be the folder used by your cloud storage sync folder of choice (e.g. your Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive folder).</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the final file name on <code>3.</code> is always the same, it will be re-written, but likely your cloud storage sync will keep track of the different versions, as they change, which could progressively inflate your quota usage. If that is a problem, just purge them periodically using your cloud storage interface.</p>

<p>You can test drive your script by granting execution privileges to your script (<code>chmod +x &lt;script_file_name&gt;</code>), and running <code>./&lt;your_script_name&gt;</code>. Your final encrypted archive should appear on the final <code>backup_folder</code></p>

<h2 id="step-2-run-the-script-when-obsidian-quits">Step 2. Run the script when Obsidian quits</h2>

<p>Now that we have the script ready, it makes our life easier if it is run automatically, upon a given Obsidian event, such as when Obsidian quits. Running a shell script upon a given Obsidian event is made easy by using the <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=obsidian-shellcommands">obsidian-shellcommands</a>. These are the steps to set it up:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Go to Obsidian -&gt; Settings. Then select the “Community Plugins” option.</p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Community Plugins">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p0.webp" aria-label="Community Plugins">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p0.png" aria-label="Community Plugins">
             <img src="/files/obsidian_backup/p0.png" aria-label="Community Plugins">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>1.1.</strong> On the “Community Plugins” option, click “Browse”. There, search for “Shell”. The one you want to install is <a href="(https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=obsidian-shellcommands)">Shell Commands by Jarkko Linnanvirta</a></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Browse for Shell Commands">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p2.webp" aria-label="Browse for Shell Commands">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p2.png" aria-label="Browse for Shell Commands">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Selected Shell Commands Plugin by Jarkko Linnanvirta">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p3.webp" aria-label="Selected Shell Commands Plugin by Jarkko Linnanvirta">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Now that the plugin is installed, go again to Obsidian -&gt; Settings. You should see in the bottom left, under the “Community plugins” pane, an option named “Shell commands”. Click it.</p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p4.webp" aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p4.png" aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
             <img src="/files/obsidian_backup/p4.png" aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong> On the “Shell commands” plugin, select the “Shell commands” tab, and inside it, click “New shell command”, and the created row, click its respective cog icon. This will show you a new modal with several tabs.</p>

<p><strong>3.2.</strong> On this command modal, select the “Environments” tab and insert on the “Default shell command” something like this: <code>zsh /Users/yourunixname/backups/my_backup_script.sh</code>. This assumes that your script is located at <code>/Users/yourunixname/backups/my_backup_script.sh</code></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="New shell commands on the Environment tab">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p5.webp" aria-label="New shell commands on the Environment tab">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p5.png" aria-label="New shell commands on the Environment tab">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>3.3.</strong> Still on this command modal, select the “Events” tab. There you can choose when should the script execution be done. For example, search for “Obsidian quits”, and enable it (there is a toggle in the right)</p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p6.webp" aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p6.png" aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
             <img src="/files/obsidian_backup/p6.png" aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="How Shell Commands looks like when everything is configured">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p7.webp" aria-label="How Shell Commands looks like when everything is configured">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p7.png" aria-label="How Shell Commands looks like when everything is configured">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>All done! After performing these steps, your backup script will run whenever you chose to, and the encrypted backup will be created and placed in the location that you chose on <a href="/notes/2024/09/11/obsidian-backup.html#step-1-custom-script-that-encrypts-and-backs-up-all-notes">Step 1.</a> above 🎉</p>

<h1 id="the-template">The Template</h1>

<h2 id="get-it">Get it</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Download / copy the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cR0oOcvwQIXsdOEbtFBoneOfdzrVYB_QkADc1h0BTBk/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet Template here</a></strong></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="how-it-is-structured">How it is structured</h2>

<p>The template has several sheets, which are built to have the essential tracking elements that can be immediately used, while also allowing for extensibility for your own custom case.</p>

<h3 id="dates-sheet">Dates sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Dates Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/pdates.webp" aria-label="Dates Sheet">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>The entire sheeet revolves around these dates. Each of these represents the temporal <em>snapshot</em> of all your assets. All the other sheets use these dates as the starting point for their values, and this would be first thing you would add whenever entering a new series of entries</p>

<h3 id="revenue-sheet">Revenue sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/prevenue.webp" aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/prevenue.png" aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
             <img src="/files/investment-tracker/prevenue.png" aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>Represents all the resources <em>coming in</em>, which are not a result of your investments. This could be the income from your salary, side-hustle, the app you are selling on the app store, etc.</p>

<h3 id="account-sheet">Account sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Account Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/paccount.webp" aria-label="Account Sheet">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/paccount.png" aria-label="Account Sheet">
             <img src="/files/investment-tracker/paccount.png" aria-label="Account Sheet">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>There are two example account sheets provided with the template, each representing a different account on your portfolio, but you can add how many you would need. These could be your bank account, transaction broker, private pension, etc. To create a new one, grab one of the example account sheets, and copy it into a new spreadsheet.</p>

<p>On the template, the <em>Example Account1</em> shows how a bank account could roughly look like, and <em>Example Account2</em> how an investment platform (such as Vanguard) could look like.</p>

<p>Each of the account sheets is structured in the following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Current status: a look at the present, and comparison with the last update
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Date Column</strong>: referenced from the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#dates-sheet">dates sheet</a>, representing the date of this current <em>snapshot</em></li>
      <li><strong>Top up movement</strong>: any money that you deposited in this account since the last date, would be accounted for here. For example, salary that is deposited, on deposits made in an investment broker. The objective here is to keep track of the money coming into a specific account, so that its performance doesnt look better than it really is.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Invested</strong>: all uninvested money sitting in the account. For example, money in a bank account which does not yield interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Invested</strong>: all money invested in this account. For example, the amount of money invested in a transaction broker, which is currently invested in stocks or ETFs.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Delta</strong>: the investment difference between the current date and the last date.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Delta, minus topup</strong>: the investment difference between the current date and the last date, minus the top up. This value attempts to represent how much money was actually generated by the investment since the last date.</li>
      <li><strong>Total</strong>: the total invested and not invested amount in the account.</li>
      <li><strong>Total Delta</strong>: total difference between current date and last date.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Expected gains: predictions of investment gains
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Expected Yearly Growth % (Gross)</strong>: for example, if overall the invested money is in a Fixed Term Deposit, this value would represent the gross yearly interest accrued from it, pre-taxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Expected Yearly Growth % (Net)</strong>: this value represents the actual expected gains from this investment. For example, taking the Fixed Term Deposit example above, this would be the expected yearly interest, after taxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Expected gains 6 months / 1 year / etc</strong>: taking into consideration the <em>Expected Yearly Growth % (Net)</em>, which would accrue gains from the investment over these time spans.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary-sheet">Summary sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Summary Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/psummary.webp" aria-label="Summary Sheet">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/psummary.png" aria-label="Summary Sheet">
             <img src="/files/investment-tracker/psummary.png" aria-label="Summary Sheet">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>This is where it all comes together. All the accounts are summed up, resulting in these new relevant columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Total</strong>: the total across all investments, for a given date</li>
  <li><strong>Total Delta</strong>: total difference between current date and last date.</li>
  <li><strong>Total Delta minus Revenue (i.e. profit / loss)</strong>: the aim of this column is to roughly represent how much of your net worth is being eaten up by your expenses:
    <ul>
      <li>If this value is negative, it means that either your costs are too high, your investments are not yielding yet high values, or both.</li>
      <li>If this value is neutral, it means that your overall investments are completely covering your costs.</li>
      <li>If this value is positive, it means that your overall investments are not only covering your costs, but are also increasing your net worth on top.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h2>

<h3 id="set-up">Set up</h3>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#get-it">Copy the template</a>, by opening it and clicking on <em>File -&gt; Make a Copy</em></li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#dates-sheet">dates sheet</a>, and leave only the top two dates. The first date would be the previous month, and the second would be the current month. Delete the rest.</li>
  <li>Go to the other sheets, and delete all the rows which don’t have a date now</li>
  <li>Zero out the first line on each of the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#account-sheet">account sheets</a> for <em>Top up Investment</em>, <em>Not Invested</em> and <em>Invested</em>.</li>
  <li>Zero out the first line of the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#revenue-sheet">revenue sheet</a>; or add your revenue from that month.</li>
  <li>Use the existing example accounts to host your own accounts. If a new account is needed:
    <ul>
      <li>Copy one of the account sheets, by right clicking on the sheet’s tab, and selecting <em>Duplicate</em></li>
      <li>Add a new column to the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#summary-sheet">summary sheets</a>, representing the new account. Change its formula’s value to get the information from your new sheet. You can do this by selecting the cell and changing the name of the referenced sheet, to the name of your new sheet. For example, from <code>'Example Account 2'!G2</code> to <code>'Monzo Bank Account'!G2</code>.</li>
      <li>Still in the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#summary-sheet">summary sheets</a>, double click the chart, select the <em>Setup</em> tab, and add the range of the new column to the list. For example, if the new column was on the <em>D</em> column, then the data range would change from <em>H7,A2:A1000,B1:B1000,C1:C1000,G1:G1000</em> to <em>H7,A2:1000,B1:B1000,C1:C1000,<strong>D1:D1000</strong>,G1:G1000</em>. Then, on the <em>Series</em> section of the <em>Setup</em> tab, click on <em>Add Series</em> and add the one from your new account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="recurrent-workflow">Recurrent workflow</h3>

<p>Once you have the above set up, I suggest that on the first days of every month, right after your main source of income is deposited (e.g. salary), that the sheet is updated with the current values of each of the accounts. This is key, and using a recurrent calendar event will help you make sure this is done. If this update is not made periodically, eventually there will be gaps in the tracking, and its data will lose relevance. The process would look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the current date to the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#dates-sheet">dates sheet</a></li>
  <li>On each the the accounts, expand the date to the new one, and fill in the current <em>Top up Investment</em>, <em>Not Invested</em> and <em>Invested</em> values</li>
  <li>All done!</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>Feel free to expand and customize the above tracker to your needs, and let me know how it could be improved and which was its impact on your investment tracking. Would love to hear your thoughts about it.</p>

Don’t postpone it.</p>

<p>This article provides concise, practical, straight to point suggestions on how to kick start your investment journey.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>Growing wealth has been vilified and correlated with the unscrupulous and greedy. Far from that, money is more than a number and currency: it provides options. The option to say <em>no</em> to that task / job you don’t want to do; options to provide for your family and close ones; options to give back to society and the world; options to support your health, well being and comfort. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>So why would you consider investing your hard earned money? Why do it as early as possible?</p>

<p>Let’s say you are 20 years old, and have zero net worth. No money in the bank, no assets. After that point, every month, <strong>for the next 30 years, you invest £250 every month</strong> (roughly equating to £8.4 per day). Let’s assume that investment yields a yearly 7% return on investment every year, on average (which is viable assumption, considering the SP500 historical performance). By 50 years old, this would be the <a href="https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/personal-finance/savings-investing/compound-interest-calculator">result</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contributions: £90,000 (250 * 12 * 30)</li>
  <li>Interest earned: £193,382 (thanks to compound interest you will gain this much. Einstein called compound percentages the 8th wonder of the world)</li>

<h2 id="long-term-game">Long term game</h2>

<p>Forget about get rich quick schemes. Going down that path would be comparable to buying lottery ticket and wish for a winning prize, but the odds of getting struck by lightning are nearly <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/leisure-recreation/powerball-mega-millions-or-a-lightning-strike-which-has-better-odds/882156">20,000 times higher</a> than hitting the winning numbers for the next Powerball jackpot.</p>

<p>Building wealth is a long term game which requires discipline, structure and time.</p>

<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>

<h2 id="create-an-emergency-fund">Create an emergency fund</h2>

<p>Make sure you have the equivalent of about 6 liquid months worth of your income available. Life is unpredictable, so make sure you have a reachable safety net which you can rely on and use promptly.</p>

<h2 id="pay-off-your-consumer-debts">Pay off your (consumer) debts</h2>

<p>Compound investment works both ways:  the more you invest, the more your wealth “snowball” will pick up along the way, growing exponentially. On the other hand, if you have debts that require you to pay interest, the inverse applies, progressively eating into your wealth.</p>

<p>As such, gather all your debts, order them by their interest rate, and make sure to pay the ones with the highest interest rate first. Prioritize non-equity based debts, such as credit card debts. Mortgages are equity based, so a portion of your payments goes towards your equity, so they would have less priority compared with pure consumer debt, but make sure they will not overburden you.</p>

<h2 id="budget">Budget</h2>

<p>Budgeting doesn’t mean living in extreme frugalness. Budgeting is about knowing what you <em>need</em> and <em>want</em>, and how much of your income would you be willing to allocate to them. Budgeting makes it easier to reason about your expenses, and having control over them, rather than them controlling you.</p>

<p>Make it as simple or complicated as you would want. You can start by putting in a sheet your monthly income, and subtract from it your fixed (e.g. rent, mortgage, internet bill) and variable expenses (e.g. entertainment, electricity bill, travel). In the end, the objective is that you have a better grasp of how much comes in / goes out. This will inform you on how much disposable income you will have available towards investments.</p>

<h2 id="automate">Automate</h2>

<p>Unless you are a professional trader, you don’t want to spend the entirety of your (limited) time and energy maintaining your investments. If so, that becomes a chore / job by itself. The whole point is to make money work for you, not the contrary.</p>

<p>So automate everything as much as possible. What you can’t automate, make it into a well defined process that requires minimal effort.</p>

<p>I suggested you review / maintain your investments only once per month, <em>every month</em>. If you are an employee, make this shortly after your paycheck comes in.</p>

<h2 id="systematize-know-where-your-assets-are-visit-them">Systematize. Know where your assets are. Visit them.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Every month, invest as much as possible from your income (this amount would be informed by your budget, and your risk appetite). You can also automate this process by scheduling a periodic amount from your bank account into your investment platform. I don’t particularly like this full automation strategy, since I prefer to adapt my investment amount to what I predict my spending will be on the following month, allowing for a tighter / more aggressive investment strategy. I personally prefer to have as little uninvested money as possible. YMMV.</li>
  <li>Make a spreadsheet. Doesn’t need to be fancy, just functional. It will only be used by you (in principle), so organize in however way you think it is best. Personally, I have different pages for each bank, trading platform, p2p platform, etc. Each of these pages has an history of the current invested amount in these platform, per month. Then an extra page summarizing / summing up all of these assets, with some optional graphs. Having this visual historical summary of all your assets in a single place is gratifying. Seeing how far you came on your investment journey, explicit in a graph, is incredibly fulfilling and powerful.</li>
  <li>Update this spreadsheet periodically, and re-balance your assets as needed. I recommend every month, right after you receive your salary. There are ways to do it automatically, but taking this time to go through all your assets provides visibility on any gaps and strategy changes that need to be done. Personally, this takes me one hour. That’s how long it takes to perform maintenance on my investments: <em>1 hour every month, that’s it</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="diversify-adapt-to-your-situation">Diversify. Adapt to your situation</h2>

<p>Having your investments diversified across different baskets allows you to balance your risks are diffuse your liabilities across different spaces, which ultimately protects you.</p>

<p>The strategy you would want to adopt for your investments in your 20s, likely won’t be the same as the strategy in your 60s. For example, later on in life, you might want to invest in safer investment vehicles, such as UK Government bonds (essentially, the country would need to go bankrupt for you to lose your money), savings accounts, cash ISAs and real estate.</p>

<h1 id="investment-vehicles">Investment Vehicles</h1>

<p>With our foundations in place, it’s time to dive into the nuts and bolts.</p>

<h2 id="max-out-your-workplace-pension">Max out your workplace pension</h2>

<p>Usually, if your are employed, your employer will make regular payments into your <a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/pensions-and-retirement/pensions-basics/the-different-pensions-you-can-get-if-you-live-and-work-in-the-uk">pension</a> pot on your behalf. And, depending on the plan you belong to, you may also make monthly contributions which will be taken from your salary. Some employers increase their contributions if you increase the monthly amount you put aside as well. This tends to be a direct match – if you put aside an extra 1%, they add an extra 1%, but there will be a maximum level they will match.</p>

<p>There are two allowances you should keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your annual allowance is the maximum level of total pension contributions to all of your pensions (made by yourself, your employer(s) or anyone else) that will receive tax relief in a tax year. It is currently £60,000, although could be lower if you have an adjusted income over £240,000 or you have already made a taxable withdrawal from any of your pension plans.</li>
  <li>The lump sum allowance (LSA) is the maximum amount of tax-free cash you can take from your pension savings in your lifetime. You can take 25% of your pot tax-free, as long as this amount is not higher than the LSA.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="own-the-world-stocks-etfs">Own the World: Stocks, ETFs</h2>

<p>Google, Apple, Tesla, NVIDIA: what if you could own a part of them and profit from their earnings by receiving dividends from them and / or getting capital gains from their (hopefully) raising share prices? </p>

<p>Turns out, you can. Either by buying their individual stocks, or better yet, you can invest on a index fund, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies">S&amp;P 500</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sp-500">S&amp;P 500</h3>

<p>S&amp;P 500 contains the top 500 U.S.A. publicly traded companies with a primary emphasis on market capitalization. Most interestingly, this list isn’t manually curated by a human or an opaque heuristic. The list is based on the market capitalization only, and it is considered one of the best gauges of large U.S. stocks and even the entire equities market because of its depth and diversity. This dilutes the risk you are exposed to, and historically has provided a realistic yearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500">~7.5%</a> return on investment.</p>

<p>You can’t invest directly in the S&amp;P 500 because it’s an index but you can invest in one of the many funds that use it as a benchmark and track its composition and performance.</p>

<p>To make it easier, you can get a S&amp;P 500 Exchange-traded fund (ETF). ETFs and index funds are similar in many ways but ETFs are considered to be more convenient to enter or exit.  They can be traded more easily than index funds and traditional mutual funds, similar to how common stocks are traded on a stock exchange.</p>

<p>Here are two S&amp;P 500 ETFs, which have a low maintenance cost:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9503/sp-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing">S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF - Distributing (VUSA)</a>: the dividends are paid out to you, and you can choose to reinvest them, invest them elsewhere, or just cash them out.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9694/sp-500-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating">S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF - Accumulating (VUAG)</a>: the dividends are automatically reinvested into the ETF, which makes the process more automatic, in case you want to reinvest your earnings (which likely, you should). Note that, even though these dividends are reinvested directly into the ETF, they are still <a href="https://monevator.com/income-tax-on-accumulation-unit/">considered as earnings by the HMRC</a>, so in the tax perspective, there is no difference between distributing and accumulating.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-etfs">Other ETFs</h3>

<p>Investing on a S&amp;P 500 is already a significant step up from plain low interest savings accounts, but you would be overly exposed to the U.S.A. market. As such, you can consider ETFs which further diversify your exposure, such as the <a href="https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9679/ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating">FTSE All-World UCITS ETF - (USD) Accumulating (VWRP)</a>, which is comprised of large and mid-sized company stocks in developed and emerging markets.</p>

<p>The above ETFs are provided by Vanguard (which tends to have low maintenance costs for their ETFs), and can be bought in several trading platforms, but there are many other reputable companies providing similar ETF, such as BlackRock.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-buy-these-stocks-and-etfs">Where to buy these Stocks and ETFs</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.justetf.com/uk/how-to/invest-in-uk.html">justetf</a>: is a great website to explore and get details on costs and performance of an ETF you are aiming to invest in</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/">Vanguard</a>: if you are starting out on your ETF investment journey, I strongly suggest this platform to invest in your ETFs. Making deposits and managing investments is straightforward and has the right amount of information and process, in order to not be overwhelming</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/home.php">Interactive Brokers</a>: this platform has been around for a long time, is low cost, well-capitalized, provides for very low cost exchange rates, and allows you to invest in a large amount of available stocks and ETFs. The trade-off is that it takes longer to onboard, due to its interface complexity and wide range of tools and information.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.trading212.com/">Trading212</a>: commission-free platform that doesn’t apply any commission on trades, but does charge <a href="https://www.trading212.com/cards">0.15% on currency conversion fees</a>. Make sure to take these hidden costs into account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vanguard, Interactive Brokers and Trading 212 are regulated in the UK by the FCA. I recommend you spread out your investments in different platforms, in order to reduce the risk / hassle in case any of them is shut down or rendered illiquid.</p>

<h2 id="isa">ISA</h2>

<p>Every time you sell the above ETFs or Stocks at a gain (for example, you bought £100 worth of an ETF, and then sold it for £150), and every time dividends are received (regardless if they are paid directly to you, or reinvested), you will need to pay taxes on them, unless you are still within their respective allowance. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>One way to not pay any of these taxes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, is to use a stocks and shares ISA. The stocks and shares ISA is one of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts">types of ISA</a>. Other ones being cash ISA (type of savings account that offers tax-free interest), innovative finance ISA (peer to peer lending with tax-free interest) and Lifetime ISA (tax-free savings account that gives a 25% bonus if used for retirement or to buy a first home).</p>

<p>As of the time of this writing, the maximum yearly amount allowed to be saved via ISAs is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts">£20,000</a>. This means that across any of the above 4 types of ISAs you can only deposit in them up to £20,000. You can withdraw them at any point in time. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Some specifics on this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a Stocks and Shares ISA is fairly straightforward. The above brokers (Vanguard, Interactive Brokers and Trading212), all allow for you to create a Stocks and Shares ISA account. This account is exactly the same as a normal / general account, except that it is tax sheltered. The ISA account would be separate from a general investment account you might want to create, in case you already reached your £20,000 limit, and want to continue investing (which I recommend).</li>
  <li>You can create ISA accounts in <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/stocks-shares-isas/">multiple providers</a> of any types you choose, but remember there is a global £20,000 limit. For example, if you have a Cash ISA on HSBC where you deposited £15,000, and Stocks and Shares ISA on Vanguard, you can only deposit up to £5,000 in Vanguard’s Stocks and Shares ISA account. You can transfer your ISA account across providers, to avoid losing your tax free investments.</li>
  <li>If you deposit £18,000 on a ISA account and then withdraw all of it, you will only be able to deposit £2,000 on a ISA account after that (on the same tax year<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>Every year, the annual ISA allowance will renew, and your investments from the previous year(s) will still have tax free gains. As such, avoid at all possible costs to withdraw your investments for these ISA accounts. Even if your ISA investment was made several years ago, their gains will still be tax free.</li>
  <li>Any capital gains and dividend gains yielded from your investments made in an ISA account will be tax free.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cashback">Cashback</h2>

<p>You can earn, while consuming. That is cashback.</p>

<p>The reason why this is possible in the first place, is because products are originally sold at a higher margin price, and cashback mechanisms are essentially a way to clawback part of that extra margin back to you. There are essentially two ways you can claim this: via credit cards (and bank accounts), cashback reward websites.</p>

<h3 id="credit-cards-and-bank-accounts">Credit cards (and bank accounts)</h3>

<p>There are several credit cards and bank accounts that allow you to gain cashback. Usually you can expect a 1% cashback rate, save from their respective promotional periods.</p>

<ul>
  <li>American Express (Amex) cards are overall the best when it comes to cashback rewards, such as the zero-fee <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-gb/credit-cards/platinum-cashback-everyday-credit-card">Amex Cashback Everyday Credit Card</a>. Trade-off being that not every establishment accepts Amex cards, so you will need a fall back.</li>
  <li>Since Amex cards are not accepted on all establishments, it is a good idea to have a backup Mastercard or Visa card, which are widely accepted. Have a browse through these <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/best-credit-card-rewards/">top cashback cards</a> to have an idea of what is available.</li>
  <li>There are credit cards which have pre-conditions, such as having minimum spend, an associated bank account, maintenance fee, amongst others, so make sure to take these into consideration to calculate your bottom-line</li>
  <li>There are credit cards which collect Avios instead, such as the <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-gb/credit-cards/ba-credit-card/">British Airways American Express® Credit Card</a>. Unless you plan to use them for travel, use their respective perks (e.g. lounge passes), and have spendings that are leveraged by these points, I would steer away from them. This is because there is an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8d7743f-0c81-4406-ad2d-0f84a2cc78a5">associated monetary value</a> with each of these points, and personally I prefer to have these saving readily available on cash.</li>
  <li>Remember to pay your credit card spending every month <em>in full</em>, otherwise you will be hit by the gargantuan interest rates (about 30%).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cashback-reward-sites">Cashback reward sites</h3>

<p>On top of the above credit card cashback rewards, you can clawback another layer of cashbacks via rewards sites. In the United Kingdom, the #1 site is <a href="https://www.topcashback.co.uk/">TopCashback</a>. To leverage it, just quickly search on their website if they offer rewards for a purchase you are about to make (e.g. hotel booking via Expedia, which easily gets you 10% cashback), use their link, and once you complete the purchase the reward will be available in a few weeks. This is incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>You can leverage other reward sites, such as the perks provided via Amex, that need to be activated, but personally, I wouldn’t bother too much with them.</p>

<h2 id="points--loyalty-cards">Points / loyalty cards</h2>

<p>Another level on top of the above cashback methods, is to use points cards on for your favorite merchants / supermarkets, which  can either provide you direct discounts, or accrue points that can be exchanged later on by discounts or perks. In general they are quick to set up, and their respective cards can be added to virtual wallets, so there is no need to carry their physical presence. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nectar.com/homepage">Nectar Card</a>: useful for Sainsbury’s purchases</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/my-waitrose/become-a-member">Waitrose Membership</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://secure.tesco.com/clubcard">Tesco Clubcard</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="watch--phone-wallet">Watch / Phone Wallet</h2>

<p>With all of the above credit and points cards, a wieldy and secure way to have them at hand is to add them to your watch or phone. Google and Apple devices largely support these wallets, and adding them is overall straightforward. One aspect I particularly like about this approach, is that carrying around credit cards using wallet appears feels more secure than carrying a physical card, which if stolen, the mechanisms available to block are mostly leveraged via the card provider, whereas via a virtual wallet, apart from have the card’s access walled by the device’s default access (e.g. pin code), the device can also be remotely wiped, if needed.</p>

<h2 id="equity-investments">Equity investments</h2>

<p>Seed investment on companies (such as startups) is not restricted to angel investors and VCs. These investments are now widely available via crowdfunding platforms such as <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">Crowdcube</a> or <a href="https://europe.republic.com/">Seedrs / Republic</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>These platforms allow you to contribute towards a round of investment in a given company.</li>
  <li>This is a high risk, high reward / loss business proposition, since there are only very specific conditions in which you can withdraw your investment (e.g. company is acquired, gets IPOed). There is a high likelihood that these companies either take a long time span to <em>exit</em>, or that they will go bankrupt.</li>
  <li>Many of these are covered by a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-tax-relief-for-investors">tax relief</a>, such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-for-the-enterprise-investment-scheme">Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)</a>, meaning that you can deduce a percentage of your investment from your taxes. For example, if you invest £100 of a company under the EIS scheme, you will be able to deduce £30 (30% of £100) from your taxes (if you do not expect to pay that amount of taxes, then this would not be useful for you).</li>
  <li>Commonly there are associated perks provided by the companies, such as redeemable vouchers on their businesses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-vehicles">Other vehicles</h2>

<p>Other investment vehicles you can consider are real estate (e.g. buy to let, REIT), commodity trading (e.g. silver, gold), forex trading (buying one currency and selling another while attempting to profit from the trade), crypto trading, p2p lending. Even though I have some experience with some of them, these are not my main focus of my investment strategy, so I’ll abstain from making many remarks on them.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>The above guide is not extensive, by all means, and there are thousands of ways to put your money to work effectively, but it is important to not go overboard and over optimize, as too much time spent on these will eventually carve away from other meaningful areas of your life, such as overly obsessing over points optimizations. This is an eventual opportunity cost, and you should be aware that these methods are a means, not the end. Optimize just enough, automate as much as possible, reap the rewards, gain options, and enjoy your life to fullest!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="einsteins-rambles">Einstein’s rambles</h2>

<p>I’ve been listening to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Einstein-Life-Universe-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1847390544">“Einstein: His Life and Universe”</a> audiobook, from Walter Isaacson, which recounts a series of curious stories of how he carried himself through his life.</p>

<p>Einstein was often known to be aloof and lost in this thoughts, so much so that when sailing his clunky 15-foot sailboat named Tinef (Yiddish for “worthless” or “junk”), he often found himself to being rescued more than once by locals near to his rented a summer cottage overlooking Cutchogue Harbor.</p>

<p>Another delightful story was when he lived in Princeton, where occasionally, he would take rambling walks on his own. One day, called into the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked, and asked to speak to a particular dean. When the secretary said that the dean wasn’t available, he hesitantly asked for Einstein’s home address. That was not possible to give out, he was informed. His voice then dropped to a whisper. “Please don’t tell anybody,” he said, “but I am Dr. Einstein, I’m on my way home, and I’ve forgotten where my house is.”</p>

<h2 id="thinking-in-safety">Thinking, in safety</h2>

<p>Over the past years, I’ve made a habit of having at least one long walk / hike every weekend. I take immense joy - if I happen to go by myself and I’m not actively listening to an audio book or am concentrating on some task - to just wander around and immerse myself in random thoughts, think about hard problems, strategise, and attempt to arrive at sound conclusions. This mental wandering, almost like a meditation, I am sure that happens for most of us, in several instances. Maybe when waking up, during the shower, during a walk, during a boring talk, when contemplating art or nature, etc.</p>

<p>Since we are not omniscient and omnipresent, we have several limitations in knowing how a given action will translate into a set of consequences, so we use probabilistic models and heuristics in our thought processes to discern which are the most likely actions that will help us arrive at a desirable outcome. And the more relevant information and time we have to process our thoughts, the better our results will be.</p>

<p>In all of these, I believe there is one common denominator that is fundamental for that process to happen: safety.</p>

<h2 id="the-influence-of-ones-environment">The influence of one’s environment</h2>

<p>Let’s assume you live with access to information and resources (food, money, shelter, etc), but are living in a situation where your surrounding environment requires you to keep alert and attentive to hazard to your physical / mental wellbeing, or you are in a situation where your social stability is dependent on incapacitating amounts of your energy and time. This could be due to living in a dangerous neighborhood, having overly demanding peers, an abusive household, etc.</p>

<p>Even though there might be a series of limited actions one could take to improve their situation, the constant fight-or-flight severely restricts the opportunities where these action plans can be considered, which eventually leads to reactive actions that could have a number of possible outcomes (good or bad), rather than surgical long term actions that would pave the path towards positive outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaway">The takeaway</h2>

<p>While many many situations are not under our control, such as our initial conditions, birth place, etc, which place a default upper bound on any possible outcomes, we do have agency over some parts of our life, and that is what we can focus on. The path to unwanted consequences is a slippery slope made of several small decisions, some under our control, others not. But for the ones we have the opportunity to control, we should.</p>

<p>For example, the peers one <em>choses</em> to have around, the <em>choice</em> to avoid short term pleasures that have a high long term cost, the <em>choice</em> of which country or neighborhood to live in, the <em>choice</em> of which job offer to strive for, etc.</p>

<p>Do notice that the italics are intentional. The <em>choices</em> above assume that those are options you have under your control to pick, which I am conscious that is not always the case.</p>

<p>Take a minute to think of what a nation is. Let’s say the United States of America. What makes someone American? Is it their physique, genetic traits, family lineage, pheromones? No, it’s a concept in their head, which stems from a mix of identity, ideology, personal gains from abiding to that concept (say, gaining currency via a job or a company, that allows you to acquire things you desire), perceived protection and support from peers because they believe you are commonly aligned on core beliefs / concepts.</p>

<p>The same can be said of a company. A company is not a physical being, it’s a shared idea in our imagination. As Yuval mentions in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0099590085">Sapiens</a>, Peugeot does not really exist, except in our minds. It doesn’t have a body, mind, anything. We have the common belief that Peugeot exists, because we also have the common belief of what a company means, we are aligned on how it should be represented and who can represent it, we recognize it as an entity with rights and duties, and which laws it should abide by.</p>

<p>Laws, as well, are worth nothing if only one person believes in them. They are powerful because a large group of people believe in them, and they expect others to do so as well. That’s why we have courts, prisons, and educational systems for that matter. They are ways to punish, format, and incentivise for the entire group to have the required level of consistency, and keep rowing in the same direction.</p>

<p>That’s why complete anarchy loses its edge on a large scale. It extinguishes the biggest thing Humans have going for them: the ability for large numbers of people to rally in common goals, even though they don’t personally know most of their fellow believers.</p>

<p>As N. K. Humphrey suggests, these ideas, behaviors, or styles that spread by means of imitation from person to person within a culture, also known as memes, could even be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically. The generational propagation of a meme outweighs the lifespan of the Human who created it, so in a way, <em>“we are living inside the dreams of dead people”</em>, as Yuval puts it.</p>

<p>That being said, how do we align on a common concept or belief?</p>

<h2 id="stories">Stories</h2>

<p>We’ve seen above how powerful and valuable having a broad range of concepts aligned within a group of people. They bring value to the whole, but also to the individual.</p>

<p>You can force someone to abide to a given concept via force (coercion, blackmailing, etc), but since they see little value going on for them, they don’t have the incentive to grow that concept inside them, or to propagate that concept to others</p>

<p>Stories however, allow you to describe a world to others that they can interpret in their head, and they can see by themselves how it would benefit them, and the ones around them. It’s an information passage mechanism that allows Humans to communicate and agree on a given concept, and they are everywhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Children’s bedtime stories - notice how several of these transmit moral values, this is, expectations of how one should behave in a given situation, in order to be in alignment with the overall group / society</li>
  <li>Novels, biographies, movies</li>
  <li>When interviewees tell you a story of their childhood, how they created their company, how they achieved X, what happened during their struggles, etc</li>
  <li>When a leader, such as a CEO, convinces others of their vision / story, and that future prospects that would derive from working in a certain direction</li>
  <li>When meeting someone, when you talk about your background and your goals</li>
  <li>When you sell you employee skills to an employers, giving a summary of your professional trajectory</li>
  <li>When politicians portray their vision on how they want to improve their nation</li>
  <li>The lore of a nation, tribe, family, and their laws / duties / rights</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="being-a-good-storyteller-is-a-powerful-skill">Being a good storyteller is a powerful skill</h3>

<p>As a species, one of our biggest distinguishing factors is that we are able to goal on highly abstract concepts that only exist in our minds, such as the concept of a company, a nation, a mission, an ideology, an intellectual relationship, the concept of money. As Yuval puts it, <em>“We are the only species with the ability to use language—not just to describe things we can see, taste, and touch, but also to invent stories about things that don’t exist.”</em></p>

<p>A magical thing happens when a group of people interpret and value that concept in the same way, and are highly aligned on it. Narrative is the first and most crucial step for leaders who want to solve big problems and shape the world for the better. After all, a person can have the greatest idea in the world, but if they fail to rally others to make that idea come alive, nothing gets done.</p>
