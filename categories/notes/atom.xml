    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Keeping up with the <a href="/notes/2024/09/12/interview_learnings_cia.html">theme</a> on capturing lessons from content I consume, I’ve recently seen an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyoVVSggPjY">interview from Lex Fridman to Gregory Aldrete</a>, an historian specializing in ancient Rome and military history, in which Gregory eloquently spoke about many of the fascinating details on the rise and fall of ancient rome. Here are my takeaways from it.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="rise-and-fall-of-rome">Rise and Fall of Rome</h1>

<h2 id="romans-were-obsessed-with-the-past">Romans were obsessed with the past</h2>

<p>Romans were absolutely obsessed with the past, especially with their own family.</p>

<p>Entering an aristocrat Roman’s house, the first thing you would see would be a big wooden cabinet with several rows of wax death masks. These masks were imprints of Roman aristocrats at the time of their death.</p>

<p>Every child in the family had obsessively memorized every accomplishment of every one of those ancestors: their career, what offices they held, what battles they fought in, what they did.</p>

<p>At a funeral, people would talk about all the things their ancestors had done. The children would take out these masks, tie them onto their own faces, and wear them in the funeral procession. They were wearing the face of their own ancestors. You, as an individual, weren’t important. You were just the latest iteration of that family, and was a huge weight to live up to the deeds of their ancestors.</p>

<h2 id="brutus-honors-the-past-kills-julius-caesar-roman-republic-dawns">Brutus honors the past, kills Julius Caesar, Roman Republic dawns</h2>

<p>Rome started out as a monarchy. They had kings and were not happy with their kings. Around 500 BC, they held a revolution and they kicked out the kings, and the Roman Republic started at that point. One of the people who played a key role in this was a man named Lucius Junius <em>Brutus</em>.</p>

<p>500 years later, Julius Caesar<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> came along as the culmination of a sequence of generals trying to overtake Rome and declare themselves as kings. Even though he was populist who provided entertainment to the state, Julius Caesar was arrogant, didn’t hide his power, ignored the senate, and got several people angry. Romans don’t like kings.</p>

<p>Just so happens that one of Caesar’s best friends is Marcus Junius Brutus. People went to Brutus’ house and wrote graffiti saying “Remember your ancestor” or “You are no real Brutus”. He had no choice. He forms a conspiracy, and on the Ides of March, 44 BC, he and 23 other senators take daggers, stick them in Julius Caesar, and kill him for acting like a king.</p>

<p>Brutus killed his best friend because of something his late ancestor did.</p>

<h2 id="filling-julius-caesars-power-void">Filling Julius Caesar’s power void</h2>

<p>Julius Caesar and left a power void. There are many contenders for filling it up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mark Antony: a relative and supporter of Julius Caesar. Most expected him to be the new Ceaser.</li>
  <li>Lepidus: another of Caesar’s lieutenants.</li>
  <li>Senate: which wants to reassert its power, to become the dominant force in Rome again.</li>
  <li>Assassins who killed Caesar: Led by Brutus and Cassius.</li>
  <li>Pompey’s son: Pompey was Caesar’s great rival. Pompey’s son, Sextus Pompey, was at the time a warlord who seized control of Sicily, one of the richest provinces, and amassed a whole navy.</li>
  <li>Octavian: Julius Caesar’s 18-year-old kid grand nephew. When Caesar’s will was opened after his death, he posthumously adopted Octavian as his son.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="octavian-emerges-victorious">Octavian emerges victorious</h2>

<p>By now being Caesar’s son, Octavian gets to rename himself Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, and it just so happened that in the Mediterranean, there were about 12 legions full of hardened soldiers following the orders of a man named Gaius Julius Caesar.</p>

<p>As such, Octavian inherits an army overnight and becomes a player in this game for power, and a civil war starts.</p>

<p>Octavian emerges from it as the victor. He wasn’t a good general and lost almost every battle, but was politically savvy and very good at manipulating public image and propaganda. Octavian waged a propaganda war against Antony, portraying Antony as a foreign aggressor allied with an enemy queen, Cleopatra, and who was an official enemy of the Roman state). Octavian takes what’s a civil war and makes it look like a war against a foreign enemy.</p>

<h2 id="octavian-is-the-king-but-cant-act-like-one">Octavian is the “king”, but can’t act like one</h2>

<p>Octavian now becomes the sole ruler, essentially a king, but could not take the same approach as Julius Caesar, otherwise he would end up murdered all the same.</p>

<p>Instead, he was very modest, lived in an ordinary house like other aristocrats, wore just a plain toga, was respectful to the Senate, and ate simple foods. He’s someone who cared about the reality of power, not its external trappings. He wanted real power, not the appearance of it.</p>

<p>In terms of government, everything seemed the same from the outside, but in reality Octavian was able to retain absolute power. He did by resigning from all public offices to give that appearance, but at the same time got voted to have the powers of a consul, by which he could command armies, he got tribune power, to control meetings at the Senate, he could veto anything, and got several other powers.</p>

<p>Each year elections are held, and notionally, these people are in charge. But floating off to the side, there Octavian, who can just appear and say that “I don’t like this, let’s change it”</p>

<h2 id="nor-can-he-be-named-like-a-king">Nor can he be named like a king</h2>

<p>Octavian wondered what to call himself. He couldn’t call himself a king, or anything that could suggest it, so instead he picked ambiguous names, that when joined an interpret in a certain way, would proved to be powerful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Augustus: Augustus could mean that someone is very pious, or could mean that something is divine.</li>
  <li>Princep<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: Meaning, first citizen. Could be interpreted as a citizen just like everybody, or the first citizen, superior to all the others.</li>
  <li>Imperator: traditionally something that soldiers shout at a victorious general who’s won a battle. Octavian took this as a permanent title, implying he was a good general<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-being-roman-meant">What being Roman meant</h2>

<p>It’s wonderful to contemplate how the roman empire in about 100 AD overlaps with the regions where olives could be grown. Romans consumed olives, grapes, wheat. Barbarians meat, dairy, beer. When you are a farmer, you tend to stay in the same place, when you raise cattle you follow them around. They are two fundamental forms of living. Diet was a big part of their culture and one of characteristics that was considered fundamentally Roman. Not having their diet was barbaric.</p>

<h2 id="roman-empire-crumbles">Roman empire crumbles</h2>

<p>There are many factors that could explain the fall of Rome, and there is not a single clear cut explanation. Even the date of the empire fall is debated. </p>

<p>Geography, climate, religion, disease (there were a whole series of waves of plague that started to hit under Marcus Aurelius and continued after him, which seemed to caused real serious death and economic disruption), Marcus Aurelius leaving is succession to his child (who turned out to be deranged), instead of picking the best suited person for that role <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, as it was done on the previous 80 years, which is often regarded as the high point of the Roman Empire.</p>

<h1 id="power-of-the-past">Power of the past</h1>

<h2 id="no-way-to-escape-the-power-of-the-past">No way to escape the power of the past</h2>

<p>Gregory and his wife wife wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Long-Shadow-Antiquity-Gregory-Aldrete/dp/144116247X">The Long Shadow of Antiquity: What Have the Greeks and Romans Done for Us?”</a>, where they provide several examples of things that we think are just in truly unique parts of our culture or things that we think are just innate to human nature, that are actually rooted in the past, such as government, education, art, architecture, language / words, culture, medicine, habits, law, the way we get married, the calendar (Julius Caesar was the one who basically came up with the 365 days, 12 months, leap years).</p>

<p>We’re the accumulation of the knowledge of several generations that have come before us. Everything we do is based on that. Otherwise, we’d all just be starting at ground zero.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-past-to-mold-the-future">Understanding the past to mold the future</h2>

<p>It’s vital to have some understanding of the past in order to make competent decisions in the present. Not just in your own life, but it’s in understanding others. You need to understand where they’re coming from, where they came from, and what shaped them, and what forces affect them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study of history is the best medicine for a sick mind; for in history you have a record of the infinite variety of human experience plainly set out for all to see: and in that record you can find for yourself and your country both examples and warnings: fine things to take as models, base things, rotten through and through, to avoid.</p>

  <p><em>― Livy, The History of Rome</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>People from antiquity had different environments, technologies, and information available, but were just as sharp as we are nowadays. They were not stupid. Even though it might seem that many concepts and ideas were invented by our contemporaries, many lessons, successes and mistakes were already discovered in the past <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. The real challenge is to incorporate them into our own lives.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>Gregory Aldrete portrayed several of these concepts beautifully, so some passages of this article are literal paraphrasing of his discourse.<a href="#fnref:4" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:6">
      <p>Kaiser, Tsar, Tzar, Czar. These are based on the word Caesar.<a href="#fnref:6" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:5">
      <p>Princep is the reason why we have “Princes” and “Princesses” afterwards. Everyone wanted to be like Octavian.<a href="#fnref:5" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>It’s from the imperator that we get the word emperor and empire.<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>How did these emperors pick the best suited person for that role, while still sticking with the tradition of leaving succession to the emperor’s children? By adopting middle aged men that they considered fit for the role.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>For example, Cicero (assassinated on the orders of Octavian and Marc Antony) is considered one of the prime examples of a good orator, and wrote at length about it. Many of his experiences, skills and tricks are still used nowadays by several orators.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As we experience an increase of massive amounts of AI generated content, this note will go through the role and added value that a connection with reality and nature brings not only to your business and craft, but also to yourself.</p>

<h2 id="striking-a-balance">Striking a balance</h2>

<p>Walking or hiking has been a recurrent weekly habit of mine for several years, and its one of my favorite activities.</p>

<p>I find it essential to have a walk outside the office / home and be in contact with the surrounding world, be it in nature or around the city. This is especially relevant for those, like me, who have their daily jobs working at the computer.</p>

<p>I love to be enthralled in the digital world, think about abstract concepts, and use digital devices to, for example, communicate this content to you. But like anything else, a balance needs to be kept, and a balance between the digital and real domains seems essential.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-added-value-of-connecting-with-reality">The added value of (connecting with) reality</h2>

<p>As generative models get better, more and more people will just assume that a given piece of text, image or video is likely fake, and I believe there will be an increased demand for a connection with the real world through experiences such as in-person events, travel, spirituality, or consumption of digital content by certified entities.</p>

<p>Businesses and creators that prove their connection with the real world and real people, will likely have an edge and rise against the noise.</p>

<p>So if you’re creating a business, a piece of content, anything really, think how it relates with the real world. Ask yourself: how can you provide that connection? How can you provide <em>reality as a service</em>?</p>

<h2 id="keep-yourself-connected-with-reality">Keep yourself connected with reality</h2>

<p>Apart from all this, and just as important, it’s for <em>you</em> to maintain <em>your</em> contact with reality.</p>

<p>So if you feel you spend too much time around the internet, digital devices, TV series, etc, I invite you to the outdoors, the world outside. It’s free, it’s accessible. You just need to open the door and step out, provided you are fortunate enough to have the required physical capabilities. I’m pretty sure that it will make your life much better.</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/09/12/interview_learnings_cia.html"/>
    <updated>2024-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/09/12/interview_learnings_cia</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>
  <div class="youtube-player" data-id="vlFAvIOUFCk" data-thumbsize="1"></div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I’ve been getting into the habit of writing down what I learned from content I consume and I’ve recently seen an interview with Andrew Bustamante,
a former CIA intelligence officer on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVVe2rCHtN0">Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett</a>.</p>

<p>Andrew Bustamante is a former covert CIA intelligence officer, US Air Force combat veteran, and Fortune 10 corporate advisor, who founded Everyday Spy, where individuals and teams are trained to leverage influence, intelligence and intent. Techniques once reserved for elite spy agencies can now serve everyday people in their pursuit of personal and professional objectives.</p>

<p>Andrew shared his candid and unfiltered views on the human condition and how his previous CIA intelligence officer (commonly known as a spy) can be leveraged towards gaining an advantage in business and everyday life, and in this article I will share some of the highlights and learnings from this interview. Here are my key takeaways:</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="do-an-action-any-action">Do an Action, Any Action</h2>

<p>For you to be a step ahead of everyone else just do an action, any action, and you’ll already be ahead of everyone. Even if you fall, you’ll already be four steps ahead of everyone else.</p>

<h2 id="two-kinds-of-people">Two kinds of people</h2>

<p>There are two kinds of people:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Those who fall victim to their fears and will be stuck on a cycle of consumption, he calls them the cogs, the bobbleheads. He mentions that we actually need them, because they are needed by the kind.</li>
  <li>Those who face their fears and produce the things that the cogs want, but fear of doing. So they exploit them.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="motivation--manipulation">Motivation &amp; Manipulation</h2>

<p>Motivation and manipulation are two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Using motivation just exploits something that people are already prone to do, and we just give them something that they want.</p>

<p>If they’re not motivated, then we use manipulation, so they can actually give us what we want.</p>

<h2 id="moral-flexibility">Moral Flexibility</h2>

<p>Moral Flexibility is a gateway for manipulation, which makes something acceptable in one context, but unacceptable in another context.</p>

<h2 id="public-private-and-secret-spheres">Public, Private and Secret Spheres</h2>

<p>Then there are three spheres: the public, the private and the secret.</p>

<h3 id="public-sphere">Public Sphere</h3>

<p>The public sphere is the safe zone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s what you wear</li>
  <li>It’s what you say in Instagram</li>
  <li>It’s what you state to everyone</li>
  <li>It’s the identity that you want other people to perceive</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="private-sphere">Private Sphere</h3>

<p>The private sphere is what the people in your inner circle see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They know your birthday</li>
  <li>They know your favorite ice cream</li>
  <li>They are the ones that really know you</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s small by definition. This makes you feel good and special, and you have this elite group which is distinct from the public.</p>

<h3 id="secret-sphere">Secret Sphere</h3>

<p>The secret sphere is where all of your secrets lie:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s the affair you’re having</li>
  <li>It was the molestation you had as a kid</li>
  <li>It’s all of your dark thoughts</li>
</ul>

<p>To move from one person’s public to secret sphere, you need to pass by the private one first.</p>

<p>We want to have someone to tell our secrets, but we don’t have enough trust on the people that are in our private sphere.</p>

<p>Once you get to someone’s secrets, they’ll trust you so much that even if you break their heart. They’ll resist leaving you, because it is very rare to find someone who we can tell our secrets to.</p>

<h2 id="core-motivations">4 Core Motivations</h2>

<p>About the four core motivations, they are described by RICE: Reward, Ideology, Coercion and Ego</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ideology is the biggest driver. This could be politics, values, morals, etc</li>
  <li>Ego comes next. Even showing yourself to the world for people to see and to validate how you want to be seen is ego. Andrew mentioned that Madre Teresa wanted to be seen as someone who is a martyr.</li>
  <li>Reward: Money, sex, alcohol, drugs, etc</li>
  <li>Coercion: this is the negative one, and includes things like blackmailing</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="questions-1-validation">2 Questions, 1 Validation</h2>

<p>If you want to get information from a person, then you can ask two questions and then follow up with the validation.</p>

<p>For example, if the other person mentioned that they have an issue with their wife, then you ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Oh what happened?”</li>
  <li>After their reply you ask: “Did she really do that?”</li>
  <li>Again, after their reply, you do a validation, so it doesn’t sound like an interrogatory, by saying for example “Yeah, I had a girlfriend that did the same thing”</li>
  <li>After their reply, you then ask another two questions, and so on and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doors-and-windows">Doors and Windows</h2>

<p>Use windows instead of doors when leading a conversation.</p>

<p>Opening a door is when you change the topic completely. For example, if the conversation is about the weather and all of a sudden you ask about someone’s income. The analogy is that you’re breaking through someone’s door.</p>

<p>Instead you’ll want to open a window, which is to leave a hint for the other party that will organically lead them towards a new ramification of the conversation. You open a window by giving a queue, a suggestion, or an implicit conversation seed.</p>

<h2 id="volunteered-information">Volunteered Information</h2>

<p>People will also volunteer information to you, and you can actually assess that by the information that they give you through their statements.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-questions">The Power of Questions</h2>

<p>The person that is asking the questions has the power over the conversation, and not the person who is saying the most words. For example, in the interview it was agreed by both  that Steve was the interviewer, so Steve had the power there.</p>

<h2 id="sadrat-in-business">SADRAT in Business</h2>

<p>Andrew mentioned how the SADRAT methodology can be used in business. SADRAT stands for: spotting, assessing, development, recruiting, agent handling and termination.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spotting is finding the client, this is, you need to kiss a lot of frogs to get to the prince.</li>
  <li>Recruit means you provide a given product in exchange for their money.</li>
  <li>Assess is about finding if someone is going to be a good productive client, so you can place your Investments on the clients that give you the return on the time span that you want. This can be known through their common traits, their profile, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="detecting-lies">Detecting Lies</h2>

<p>In order to know if someone is a liar, you need to first establish a baseline. Once that is acquired, you need to put pressure on them to see if they react differently.</p>

<p>The difference between good liars and bad liars is that bad liars tend to twitch and turn, as if they were in a hot seat when they get exposed to pressure.</p>

<p>Good liars, on the other hand, they occlude all of these signals. Good liars tend to be the ones at parties that ask a lot of questions, and you felt like they were so friendly, but in reality you know nothing about them.</p>

<h2 id="perception-vs-perspective">Perception vs Perspective</h2>

<p>Perception is your gut view. Perspective is seeing the event through other lenses.</p>

<p>You should not trust your perception, because most of the time it is wrong and it is emotion based. You need to use your rational side to process challenging situations.</p>

<p>To achieve that, you need to be inoculated by getting exposed to small doses of something you fear. For example, asking someone if you’re overweight. You’ll get the physical fear arousal, but once it’s over no real harm was done.</p>

<p>You can train yourself to not respond to that physical jolt to make your emotional part slower, and your rational part faster.</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/09/11/obsidian-backup.html"/>
    <updated>2024-09-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/09/11/obsidian-backup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After several years using Evernote, I’ve eventually migrated all my notes into Obsidian, which allowed me to have full control of my notes, in a format that I could use, move, or <a href="/machine_learning/2024/06/24/personal-llm.html">leverage upon</a>. As a consequence, my notes would no longer live in the cloud and my personal device, so any redundancy and backups would need to be guaranteed by me, via my personal periodic backups.</p>

<p>Having more than a decade’s worth of notes relying on a single redundancy made me somewhat uneasy, so the options I could think of were either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Subscribe to <a href="https://obsidian.md/sync">Obsidian’s Sync service</a>, which would recurrently cost $4 every month, <em>every month</em>. My encrypted notes would be tethered to Obsidian’s cloud service</li>
  <li>Have a custom solution that leverage’s Obsidian’s outstanding customizability, compress and encrypt all my notes, and use a cloud service to host this archive. I would have the flexibility to choose any cloud provider I would desire.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve chosen option 2., using the Google Drive cloud service, and in this note will share how you can too.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h1>

<p>The idea is simple: use the <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=obsidian-shellcommands">obsidian-shellcommands</a> shell plugin to run a custom script, whenever Obsidian quits. This event is configurable, but I find the application quit event to have the necessary periodicity for my use case, since I often sporadically open Obsidian, write on it, and exit the application straight after.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-custom-script-that-encrypts-and-backs-up-all-notes">Step 1. Custom script that encrypts and backs up all notes</h2>

<p>First, save the below script into a folder in your computer (for example, at <code>/Users/yourunixname/backups/my_backup_script.sh</code>), and update it with your own Obsidian, backup destination folders and your own archive password:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/zsh

obsidian_notes_folder=&quot;&lt;your_obsidian_folder&gt;&quot; ; # For example, /Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/obsidian
obsidian_notes_tar_archive=&quot;${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_backup.tar.gz&quot; ;
backup_folder=&quot;&lt;folder_where_the_final_encrypted_backup_will_be_placed&gt;&quot;; # For example, /Users/yourusername/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive/MyDrive/backup_folder

echo &quot;Starting to compress obsidian notes...&quot; ;

# Create a .tar archive that contains all the contents inside the obsidian folder
tar -czf ${obsidian_notes_tar_archive} ${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_backup

# Compress the .tar archive into an encrypted .7z with password &quot;PasswordOfYourChoosing&quot;
# In this example, 7za installed from the nix package manager is used (https://nixos.org/), but you can use 7za from any other reputable source
/Users/yourusername/.nix-profile/bin/7za a -tzip -mem=AES256 -mx=0 -mmt=12 -pPasswordOfYourChoosing ${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_backup.7z ${obsidian_notes_tar_archive} ;

# Move the .7z file into the the backup folder (e.g. your Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive folder)
mv ${obsidian_notes_folder}/obsidian_backup.7z ${backup_folder}/obsidian_backup.7z ;

echo &quot;Finished compressing and moving to backup folder&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>(Download this <a href="https://gist.github.com/lopespm/fcfceebc311d8ba364919cdf4fa61e8d">script from GitHub Gists</a>)</em></p>

<p>The comments are mostly self-explanatory, but essentially this is what the script does:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First create a .tar archive that contains all the contents inside the obsidian folder</li>
  <li>Compresses the .tar archive into a password encrypted <code>.7z</code> file. Remember to update the password with your own private password</li>
  <li>Moves the <code>.7z</code> file into the destination folder, which could be the folder used by your cloud storage sync folder of choice (e.g. your Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive folder).</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the final file name on <code>3.</code> is always the same, it will be re-written, but likely your cloud storage sync will keep track of the different versions, as they change, which could progressively inflate your quota usage. If that is a problem, just purge them periodically using your cloud storage interface.</p>

<p>You can test drive your script by granting execution privileges to your script (<code>chmod +x &lt;script_file_name&gt;</code>), and running <code>./&lt;your_script_name&gt;</code>. Your final encrypted archive should appear on the final <code>backup_folder</code></p>

<h2 id="step-2-run-the-script-when-obsidian-quits">Step 2. Run the script when Obsidian quits</h2>

<p>Now that we have the script ready, it makes our life easier if it is run automatically, upon a given Obsidian event, such as when Obsidian quits. Running a shell script upon a given Obsidian event is made easy by using the <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=obsidian-shellcommands">obsidian-shellcommands</a>. These are the steps to set it up:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Go to Obsidian -&gt; Settings. Then select the “Community Plugins” option.</p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Community Plugins">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p0.webp" aria-label="Community Plugins">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p0.png" aria-label="Community Plugins">
             <img src="/files/obsidian_backup/p0.png" aria-label="Community Plugins">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>1.1.</strong> On the “Community Plugins” option, click “Browse”. There, search for “Shell”. The one you want to install is <a href="(https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=obsidian-shellcommands)">Shell Commands by Jarkko Linnanvirta</a></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Browse for Shell Commands">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p2.webp" aria-label="Browse for Shell Commands">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p2.png" aria-label="Browse for Shell Commands">
             <img src="/files/obsidian_backup/p2.png" aria-label="Browse for Shell Commands">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Selected Shell Commands Plugin by Jarkko Linnanvirta">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p3.webp" aria-label="Selected Shell Commands Plugin by Jarkko Linnanvirta">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Now that the plugin is installed, go again to Obsidian -&gt; Settings. You should see in the bottom left, under the “Community plugins” pane, an option named “Shell commands”. Click it.</p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p4.webp" aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p4.png" aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
             <img src="/files/obsidian_backup/p4.png" aria-label="Shell Commands Plugin entrypoint">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong> On the “Shell commands” plugin, select the “Shell commands” tab, and inside it, click “New shell command”, and the created row, click its respective cog icon. This will show you a new modal with several tabs.</p>

<p><strong>3.2.</strong> On this command modal, select the “Environments” tab and insert on the “Default shell command” something like this: <code>zsh /Users/yourunixname/backups/my_backup_script.sh</code>. This assumes that your script is located at <code>/Users/yourunixname/backups/my_backup_script.sh</code></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="New shell commands on the Environment tab">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p5.webp" aria-label="New shell commands on the Environment tab">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p5.png" aria-label="New shell commands on the Environment tab">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>3.3.</strong> Still on this command modal, select the “Events” tab. There you can choose when should the script execution be done. For example, search for “Obsidian quits”, and enable it (there is a toggle in the right)</p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p6.webp" aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p6.png" aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
             <img src="/files/obsidian_backup/p6.png" aria-label="New shell commands on the Events tab">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="How Shell Commands looks like when everything is configured">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p7.webp" aria-label="How Shell Commands looks like when everything is configured">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/obsidian_backup/p7.png" aria-label="How Shell Commands looks like when everything is configured">

           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>All done! After performing these steps, your backup script will run whenever you chose to, and the encrypted backup will be created and placed in the location that you chose on <a href="/notes/2024/09/11/obsidian-backup.html#step-1-custom-script-that-encrypts-and-backs-up-all-notes">Step 1.</a> above 🎉</p>

<h1 id="the-template">The Template</h1>

<h2 id="get-it">Get it</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Download / copy the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cR0oOcvwQIXsdOEbtFBoneOfdzrVYB_QkADc1h0BTBk/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet Template here</a></strong></li>
  <li><a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#how-to-use-it">How to use it</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-it-is-structured">How it is structured</h2>

<p>The template has several sheets, which are built to have the essential tracking elements that can be immediately used, while also allowing for extensibility for your own custom case.</p>

<h3 id="dates-sheet">Dates sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Dates Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/pdates.webp" aria-label="Dates Sheet">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/pdates.png" aria-label="Dates Sheet">
             <img src="/files/investment-tracker/pdates.png" aria-label="Dates Sheet">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>The entire sheeet revolves around these dates. Each of these represents the temporal <em>snapshot</em> of all your assets. All the other sheets use these dates as the starting point for their values, and this would be first thing you would add whenever entering a new series of entries</p>

<h3 id="revenue-sheet">Revenue sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/prevenue.webp" aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/prevenue.png" aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
             <img src="/files/investment-tracker/prevenue.png" aria-label="Revenue Sheet">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>Represents all the resources <em>coming in</em>, which are not a result of your investments. This could be the income from your salary, side-hustle, the app you are selling on the app store, etc.</p>

<h3 id="account-sheet">Account sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Account Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/paccount.webp" aria-label="Account Sheet">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/paccount.png" aria-label="Account Sheet">
             <img src="/files/investment-tracker/paccount.png" aria-label="Account Sheet">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>There are two example account sheets provided with the template, each representing a different account on your portfolio, but you can add how many you would need. These could be your bank account, transaction broker, private pension, etc. To create a new one, grab one of the example account sheets, and copy it into a new spreadsheet.</p>

<p>On the template, the <em>Example Account1</em> shows how a bank account could roughly look like, and <em>Example Account2</em> how an investment platform (such as Vanguard) could look like.</p>

<p>Each of the account sheets is structured in the following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Current status: a look at the present, and comparison with the last update
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Date Column</strong>: referenced from the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#dates-sheet">dates sheet</a>, representing the date of this current <em>snapshot</em></li>
      <li><strong>Top up movement</strong>: any money that you deposited in this account since the last date, would be accounted for here. For example, salary that is deposited, on deposits made in an investment broker. The objective here is to keep track of the money coming into a specific account, so that its performance doesnt look better than it really is.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Invested</strong>: all uninvested money sitting in the account. For example, money in a bank account which does not yield interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Invested</strong>: all money invested in this account. For example, the amount of money invested in a transaction broker, which is currently invested in stocks or ETFs.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Delta</strong>: the investment difference between the current date and the last date.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Delta, minus topup</strong>: the investment difference between the current date and the last date, minus the top up. This value attempts to represent how much money was actually generated by the investment since the last date.</li>
      <li><strong>Total</strong>: the total invested and not invested amount in the account.</li>
      <li><strong>Total Delta</strong>: total difference between current date and last date.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Expected gains: predictions of investment gains
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Expected Yearly Growth % (Gross)</strong>: for example, if overall the invested money is in a Fixed Term Deposit, this value would represent the gross yearly interest accrued from it, pre-taxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Expected Yearly Growth % (Net)</strong>: this value represents the actual expected gains from this investment. For example, taking the Fixed Term Deposit example above, this would be the expected yearly interest, after taxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Expected gains 6 months / 1 year / etc</strong>: taking into consideration the <em>Expected Yearly Growth % (Net)</em>, which would accrue gains from the investment over these time spans.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary-sheet">Summary sheet</h3>

<p><center>
          <picture aria-label="Summary Sheet">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/psummary.webp" aria-label="Summary Sheet">
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/investment-tracker/psummary.png" aria-label="Summary Sheet">
             <img src="/files/investment-tracker/psummary.png" aria-label="Summary Sheet">
           </picture>
         </center></p>

<p>This is where it all comes together. All the accounts are summed up, resulting in these new relevant columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Total</strong>: the total across all investments, for a given date</li>
  <li><strong>Total Delta</strong>: total difference between current date and last date.</li>
  <li><strong>Total Delta minus Revenue (i.e. profit / loss)</strong>: the aim of this column is to roughly represent how much of your net worth is being eaten up by your expenses:
    <ul>
      <li>If this value is negative, it means that either your costs are too high, your investments are not yielding yet high values, or both.</li>
      <li>If this value is neutral, it means that your overall investments are completely covering your costs.</li>
      <li>If this value is positive, it means that your overall investments are not only covering your costs, but are also increasing your net worth on top.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h2>

<h3 id="set-up">Set up</h3>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#get-it">Copy the template</a>, by opening it and clicking on <em>File -&gt; Make a Copy</em></li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#dates-sheet">dates sheet</a>, and leave only the top two dates. The first date would be the previous month, and the second would be the current month. Delete the rest.</li>
  <li>Go to the other sheets, and delete all the rows which don’t have a date now</li>
  <li>Zero out the first line on each of the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#account-sheet">account sheets</a> for <em>Top up Investment</em>, <em>Not Invested</em> and <em>Invested</em>.</li>
  <li>Zero out the first line of the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#revenue-sheet">revenue sheet</a>; or add your revenue from that month.</li>
  <li>Use the existing example accounts to host your own accounts. If a new account is needed:
    <ul>
      <li>Copy one of the account sheets, by right clicking on the sheet’s tab, and selecting <em>Duplicate</em></li>
      <li>Add a new column to the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#summary-sheet">summary sheets</a>, representing the new account. Change its formula’s value to get the information from your new sheet. You can do this by selecting the cell and changing the name of the referenced sheet, to the name of your new sheet. For example, from <code>'Example Account 2'!G2</code> to <code>'Monzo Bank Account'!G2</code>.</li>
      <li>Still in the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#summary-sheet">summary sheets</a>, double click the chart, select the <em>Setup</em> tab, and add the range of the new column to the list. For example, if the new column was on the <em>D</em> column, then the data range would change from <em>H7,A2:A1000,B1:B1000,C1:C1000,G1:G1000</em> to <em>H7,A2:1000,B1:B1000,C1:C1000,<strong>D1:D1000</strong>,G1:G1000</em>. Then, on the <em>Series</em> section of the <em>Setup</em> tab, click on <em>Add Series</em> and add the one from your new account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="recurrent-workflow">Recurrent workflow</h3>

<p>Once you have the above set up, I suggest that on the first days of every month, right after your main source of income is deposited (e.g. salary), that the sheet is updated with the current values of each of the accounts. This is key, and using a recurrent calendar event will help you make sure this is done. If this update is not made periodically, eventually there will be gaps in the tracking, and its data will lose relevance. The process would look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the current date to the <a href="/notes/2024/09/01/investment-tracker.html#dates-sheet">dates sheet</a></li>
  <li>On each the the accounts, expand the date to the new one, and fill in the current <em>Top up Investment</em>, <em>Not Invested</em> and <em>Invested</em> values</li>
  <li>All done!</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>Feel free to expand and customize the above tracker to your needs, and let me know how it could be improved and which was its impact on your investment tracking. Would love to hear your thoughts about it.</p>
