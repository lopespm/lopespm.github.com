<p>[share the map locations on google maps]</p>

<p>I’ve recently been to NYC. It was one of the most interesting experience I’ve done in my life. Here’s some tips:</p>

<p>I didn’t consider myself to be the type of person who takes pictures of almsot everything. I’ve discovered in this trip that I was probably wrong. I can’t recall the last time I took so many photos, it was like I was in an outstanding candy store of visual goodies.</p>

<p>Each one has their own experience and view of visiting the city, and I’ve asked several people on theirs, which helped immesnly in planning out my itenerary. Now it’s my time to pay it forward. Here the guide / personal perspective of New York:</p>

<h2 id="the-map">The Map</h2>

<p>Having a pre-curated list of points of interest on Google Maps was one of the most useful and time efficient aspects of the entire trip. This allowed me to quickly improvise and make the most of my surroundings, since I could just look at the map to check which nearby places could I visit at any given time.</p>

<p>(insert picture of the map, and the link to it)</p>

<h2 id="museums">Museums</h2>

<p>Let’s start by fashion. I’ve been pointed out that the glasses I wear daily make me look nerdy / square / too serious / look like an engineer. Well, thanks to this museum piece, I can now say they were developed for space walks:</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">

</div>

<p>Oh, and look back and you will also see the Space Shuttle <em>Enterprise</em>, the first orbiter of the Space Shuttle system:</p>

  <div class="image-mosaic-card" style="background-image: url('{{ root_url }}/files/nyc/PXL_20231210_162348213.jpg')"></div>
</div>

<p>You can find these glasses, the space shuttle, sit inside the mercury capsule or X, see real life jet planes like the B52, in the intrpid museum.</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">

<p>Where is the intrepid museum? The museum is an air carrier. Yes, the vessel IS the museum. You can explore several of it’s interior sections</p>

<p>do a tour inside a diesel powered submarine that was once used during the cold war, retro-fitted with nuclear missile (put more detail here)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fun fact: these diesel submarine was retro fitted, so they needed to constantly get refueled and had a circular patrol towards russia. The families of the crew members knew nothing about their mission, and that if they did launch a nuclear missile, they would be exposed, and most likely be killed as they expose themselves to launch the nuclear load (not to mention the anyhilation that comes from the nuclear warhead)</p>
  </li>
  <li>I asked 3 questions (that the helpful staff most patitially took the time to answer, and one of the ladies even asked me “are you an engineer?”. Busted. I’m not sure what gave that away, if was were my questions, or my glasses :) :</li>
  <li>how can they pump out the exhaut gas?</li>
  <li>how can they reload the nuclear thing?</li>
  <li>
    <p>are the motors eletrict or does one of the diesel generators connect directly to it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve lsot count to the amount of dinossaur skeeletons I’ve seen in the natural history history museum. It’s truly impressive. Nothing quite prepares you to see a gigantic sketelton of a XXXX</p>
  </li>
  <li>The MET. If you like the british museum, you will love MET. They reconstructed this this temple, must I say more?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>where to eat:
- shwarma - cops were eating there
- deli - order te oscar
- wan wan</p>

<ul>
  <li>NY HI - make sure to go to to the free comedy sessions on friday, they are quite good</li>
  <li>citizen m, for good quality, good location, fair pricing
    <ul>
      <li>show the views from the terrace</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>comedy cellar. down to earth, edgy comedy, wear you are asked to leave your phone in a pouch, so you are really present, and the comedians are notciably more at ease (cancel culture is a ressouding fear [get another word for his])</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>broadway shows. If you are from london, or are closer to london, don’t see the musicals that are available already in london, and in some cases, they are actually better, like hamilton. chicago is a good bet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>met cloisters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>columbia university</p>
  </li>
  <li>grant’s tomb</li>
  <li>
    <p>the joker stairs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>911 memorial</p>
  </li>
  <li>subway is shallow and follows the streets</li>
  <li>beware of the open trap doors, be attentive to surroundings</li>
  <li>birthplace of hip hop</li>
  <li>staten island ferry to see the statue liberty. it is free, but there will be several people with vests cajuling you to buy their trip. you don’t need to</li>
  <li>which leads to hustling. NYC is a hustle city, and you can feel that there is much less social secirtuy and safety net. might be because of that why criminality raised during covid</li>
  <li>walking is one of the best ways to discover the city. I did the large majority of my exploration of the city over the span of 180km throughout 4 days. wearing vivos to do so, is amazing. My feet were sore, but happy.</li>
  <li>brooklyn is well worth the visit, parkm museum and library.</li>
  <li>did you know that jay z is from brooklyin, cardi B from the bronx, jennifer lopez from the bronx, </li>
  <li>want to eat somthing and you are in the center, ilek times saure? walk two blows to the west and you are in hells kitchen, whihc has tons of selction, at better prices
    <ul>
      <li>did you know that alicia jeys from hells ktchen?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the place where trump took a photo in the elevator, it’s in the 5th avenue, that the same avenue, where the rockefeeler tree is, saks (which has a nice visual spectacle there), etc</li>
  <li>be prepared to be encounter several people who are not as well off, and living the streets. be respectable and don’t engage actively. keep out of confusion, and if you are in a rougher area, be attentive and memorize your path and keep walking, you don’t want to look like a toursit there. use you common sense</li>
  <li>
    <p>in the place, 85% of people are looking at the screen in front. do realize that your time is precious. a long haul flight could be a great opportuinity to catch up on a book or write and reflect about what you learned in your trip (like this)</p>
  </li>
  <li>I will never again think anything badly of the London tube. Seeing the NYC tube gave me perspective</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="money">Money</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Stores, food establishments (even chains), bodegas, 7-11s, etc present their prices as pre-tax. New York City sales tax ranges from 4% to 8.875%, and <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/listings_of_taxable_and_exempt_food.htm">some products are exempt from it</a>. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to tip everywhere. On restaurants it is customary to tip 20%. There is some debate about whether you should calculate the tip on the amount before or after tax. </li>
  <li>You don’t really need cash. You do need it if you want to buy from street vendors, or if you want to dodge the additional cost that certain sellers inpose on card transations (like the shwarma above)  </li>
  <li>On restaurants and entertainment venues, it is common practice for the attendand to leave with the credit card, to later return with an attached invoice that is meant to be signed and filled with the tipping amount. 
    <ul>
      <li>It also happened to me that when trying to pay by contactless card to a market vendor, the card kept being rejected, and since the card insertion feature was not available, the vendor wrote down the card number and details into the system to proceed with the payment. That failed as well, because the card got blocked by my bank due to a false-positive suspected fraud, as I later discovered. Eventually I just payed with cash to resolve the issue. </li>
      <li>As an european, the practice of being physically separated from the card, verification via signature, and freely writting down credit card numbers strike me as quite unsecure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The smells:
- laundry detergent, gargabe, road paint (it’s incredibly poignant), the “subway smell”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Top views. I didnt go to, but one if the common pieces of advice is to avoid empire state uilding miradouro, becasue you cant actually it. Get a room in citizenM, and you will have it as an extra</p>
  </li>
  <li>Speaking of music, in Midtown Manhattan -located on the Manhattan Island (yes, <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan#/media/File:New_York_City_location_Manhattan.svg">Island</a>), where you’ll find almost all of the best known attractions of New York - there are two songs which you’ll listen several times:</li>
  <li>Empire State of Mind, a song from Alicia Keys (raised in Hell’s Kitchen, NYC) and JayZ (raised in Brooklyn, NYC)</li>
  <li>All I want for Christmas is You, a song from Mariah Carey (raised in Huntisgton, NYC)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-around">Getting Around</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Walking through the perpendicular numbered streets and avenues is an absolute bliss, and makes it quite easy to navigate through them. Several times I just looked at the map and quickly memorized something like “3 right, 2 left”, which translated to “cross 3 roads and turn right, and then cross 2 roads and turn left”. This would keep me walking going for a long time and have time to appreciate the surroundings, without the need to constantly check the map.</li>
  <li>Subway and Bus now have OMNI, which just means that you can tap in with your credit / debit card. Each ride costs each ride is $2.90 everywhere, there are no different prices for different zones. This has a [rolling 7 day price cap] (https://omny.info/fares), so you never pay more than $34 over that period.
    <ul>
      <li>Metro Card is the pre-paid version of this. You need one, buy them directly from the machines to avoid being scammed. For example, a 7-Day Unlimited MetroCard costs $34 upfront, and can be used any number of times during those 7 days. 
        <ul>
          <li>Be aware that if you swipe in, get out from the station, and then attempt to shortly after swipe in again, it will reject your swipe, due to being to recent. If that happens, ask a MTA attendant to let you in (if available), or do like many others and wait for someone to crack open the emergency exit from the inside. If you hear an alarm going off in the station, most likely is because someone opened the emergency exit to let other’s in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Just like routine events such as figuring out post-tax prices purchases or how much and when to tip require some kind of mental effort, figuring out the different edge cases of the subway system will keep your mind busy. It is like there is a perpetual rat race game being played in the city.
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes trains stop on all stations, sometimes they don’t, sometimes trains have indicators of which station you are in, sometimes they don’t, sometimes the station has (non-standard) indications of how much time it takes for next train to arrive, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes it rains heavily inside the stations, sometimes it doesn’t.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Ever since I was a kid I had considrable fascination with the USA. The culture that arrived through the small and big screens, the big companies and entrewpnrurs that I admired, the language, the people I’ve met along the way, the stories. Having had the oporunity to visit it and expirence first hand was a true priviledge. I’ve lived it like it was the last time I would visit it, and it imprinted in me several thoughts and perspetives that I’m sure to last my lifetime.</p>

<p>New York is no Disney Land, and Elmo’s pictures in times square don’t come for free either, so set expectations accordingly. It can be one of the most fulfilling experiences you’ll ever have. I advise you to come prepared and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Frank sinatra sang that he wants “to wake up in the city that doens’t sleep”. That phrase has a deep meaning, that only struck me upon my trip. The city does not indeed sleep. Times sqaure lights, 24 hour subway, the constant movement. Living in NYC does wakes you up, not only literally, but also figuratively. It’s the wake up towards a different reality that keeps you on your toes in several ways. In a way, it is a celebration of being alive.</p>

<p>It feels like you are constantly playing a game when living in New York</p>

    <updated>2023-10-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lopespm.github.io/notes/2023/10/21/investment_relative_cost_benefit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s say you spend <span>$</span>1,000 to acquire film equipment (camera, microphones, and lights) to shoot YouTube videos. If you use this equipment to film and publish 2 videos, it means that each of those videos costs <span>$</span>500 to produce. If 100 videos are published, each of them cost <span>$</span>10. If all of these videos are able to generate <span>$</span>10 of revenue, then the entire cost of the initial investment was amortized.</p>

<p>The above is a severely gross simplification<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the key point is that an investment left unused has a high associated cost. In the case above, if only two videos were to be produced, then it would have been a better idea to rent the equipment instead.</p>

<p>This simple heuristic of mapping the investment cost to its usage and upside, can be a potential rule of thumb in different scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="other-examples">Other Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apartment Rent</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You are renting an apartment for <span>$</span>1,000 per month. During the week you work in an office, on weekends you are sometimes out, and during the year you take sporadic vacations outside. Let’s say that, on average, you spend 14 hours per day on your apartment, including sleep → 14 hours * 30 days = 420 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that it costs costs about <span>$</span>33 per day to live in the apartment, or <span>$</span>2.3 per hour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Study → Work → Net Worth Gain</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You studied 30 hours per week for 3 years (30 hours per week * 52 weeks * 3 years = 4680 hours) to land a job that increases your net worth <span>$</span>10.000 every year (on average), for 30 years. A total of <span>$</span>300,000 of networth gains.</li>
      <li>This means that you will gain about <span>$</span>64 for each hour invested in studying, or $274 per day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Clothing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy pair of trousers for <span>$</span>50, and wear them twice per month throughout for 2 years (24 months * 2 times per month = 48 times these were used).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs about <span>$</span>1 to wear them each time.
        <ul>
          <li>By contrast, if these trousers were only used <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860620/fast-fashion-zara-hm-forever-21-boohoo-environment-cost">7 times</a>, it would cost about <span>$</span>7.14 to wear them each time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a Playstation 5 for <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console"><span>$</span>499.99</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/01/ps4_has_a_very_high_software_attach_rate_average_player_owns_around_ten_games">10 games</a> (<span>$</span>60 each) totalling <span>$</span>1.100. You play <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/ld7zuo/what_was_your_total_amount_of_hours_played_in_2020/">60 hours per year</a> during 5 years (60 hours * 5 years = 300 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that each playing hour costs about <span>$</span>3.6.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phone</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy an iPhone 15 Pro for <span>$</span>999, and use it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59952557">4.8 hours per day</a> during <a href="https://www.iphonelife.com/content/how-long-do-iphone-last-how-to-know-when-to-upgrade-your-iphone">2 years</a> (4.8 hours * 365 days * 2 years = 3504 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.29 per hour of active usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Computer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a MacBook Pro 13” for <span>$</span>$1299, and <a href="https://mediapeanut.com/how-long-should-a-macbook-pro-last/">use it</a> 3 times per week for 2.5 hours per session, throughout 7 years (3 times per week * 2.5 hours * 52 weeks per year * 7 years = 2730 hours)</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.48 per hour of usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Musical Instrument</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a guitar for <span>$</span>100. You play the guitar once per week, for one hour, during 2 years. 52 weeks * 1 hour * 2 years = 104 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour playing the guitar has a cost of <span>$</span>1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Video Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a standard Netflix subscription that costs <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926/us"><span>$</span>15.99 per month</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/advisor/vpn/netflix-statistics">3.2 hours</a> (3.2 hours * 30 days = 96 hours per month) of videos throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This mean that each hour costs about $0.17.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Audio Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a premium Spotify subscription that costs <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"><span>$</span>10.99 per month</a>, and listen to about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/813876/spotify-monthly-active-users-time-spent-listening/">25 hours</a> of music and podcasts throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour costs about <span>$</span>0.44.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We could go on with further examples, as this simple heuristic could be applied to several scenarios, and the cost cost benefit analysis could have any perspective one so desires, but I would invite you to visit your storage and search for something you acquired long ago that got used less times than expected, and do a rough calculation of what was it’s relative cost / benefit.
The same for any other investment you did in the past.</p>

<p>Was it a surprising result?</p>

<p>How did it stack up against your initial expectations?</p>

<p><br /></p>

      <p><em>This gross simplification is meant to keep the example simple, and does not take into account other direct and indirect costs, such as the computer needed to edit the videos, electricity costs, office space costs, labor costs. It also does not take into account the gained equity, this is, you could sell the equipment and get some of that investment back. This was not considered because if the equipment breaks its value is rendered to zero, and when / if it is sold, it would be for a fraction at the initial value, not only because its inherent value would likely decrease through the years, but also because of inflation.</em><a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously, in <a href="{% post_url 2022-03-22-learnings-software-engineer-techlead %}">“Learnings as a Software Engineer Techlead”</a>, I’ve alluded to the 75/25 rule, where if you are ~75% certain that someone will correctly execute a given project/task, then delegate. The other ~25% is the unknown space that the person needs in order to learn, explore, make errors, innovate and grow.</p>

<p>If the project/task was decided to be delegated, what comes next?</p>

<h2 id="clarity-of-goals">Clarity of Goals</h2>

<p>One common challenge I’ve confronted when delegating was how unpredictable and uncontrollable the results felt upon handing over the work. This unstructured approach often left me thinking how I could decrease the non-completion risk by diminishing the delegated scope, and created confusion on the delegatee side on how they could proceed.</p>

<p>One tidbit of information from the “Who not How” book provided the guidance and structure to unlock this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(…) research has found that teams who have high levels of autonomy but low clarity goals, as well as little performance feedback, perform worse than teams with low autonomy.</p>

  <p><em>― <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Not-How-Accelerating-Teamwork-ebook/dp/B0867ZJ151">Who not How, by Dan Sullivan with Dr. Benjamin Hardy</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is claimed in the above research that teams which have high autonomy, high goal clarity and regular feedback on their results, were observed to have their performance shooting through the roof.</p>

<p>Apart from regular feedback, goal clarity is incredibly important, and even though it might sound obvious, it can be overlooked and drowned out on the process of delegation.</p>

<h2 id="clarity-in-practice">Clarity, in Practice</h2>

<p>After the above realization, I’ve made it a priority for each piece of delegated work to clearly define what was expected as an outcome, its definition of done, important milestones and deadlines, when should an issue be scaled to me, and which are the ownerships for each of the participants.</p>

<p>All of the above communicated in a clear and concise way, and preferably publicly documented to increase accountability and decrease ambiguity (depending on the situation, merely communicating these verbally might be enough, especially if the task is simple).</p>

<h2 id="the-delegation-formula">The Delegation Formula</h2>

<p>Given the above, the proposed formula for delegation is:</p>

<p><em>Delegation = [ 75/25 rule -&gt; Goal Clarity + Autonomy + Regular Feedback ]</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Life has several exits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The exit from your workplace. The last day of work for your employer or your company.</li>
  <li>The exit from that youth group that accompanied you through teenage years and early adulthood.</li>
  <li>The exit from your high-school.</li>
  <li>The exit from your hometown.</li>
  <li>The exit from a long term relationship.</li>
  <li>The exit from life. Your funeral.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon your exit, your contributions, actions, decisions, opinions and presence most likely will have affected the trajectories of the people and the world around you, in obvious and less obvious ways. Perhaps your own trajectory was deeply changed as well.</p>

<p>These exits may be celebrated, be a special day with fulfilling words and thoughts. They may be the last time you see a set of people. The last time you will see them in your entire life.</p>

<p>Perhaps upon your final exit, you have made such consequential dents on the world that your name will be engraved into the annals of history for centuries to come. On the other hand, contemporary personalities such Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Warren Buffet might be mostly forgotten a few centuries from now. People will move on, so most likely you should be grateful if your loved ones keep you in their thoughts for those ensuing decades.</p>

<p>Life has several exits. Life is also short and limited. There’ll be a finite number of exits you will experience. Make the most out of each period they enclose.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to want something. If you are fortunate enough to be on <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels/income-level-4/">income level 4</a> living in a peaceful nation, the world has so much to offer, within easy reach. Yet, the currencies required to enjoy them are limited: time, energy, health, money. Even though it is easy to make lists of everything one wants (typically occurring on yearly passages, such as new year’s and anniversaries), only a handful of them are achievable.</p>

<h2 id="smaller-lists-require-sacrifices">Smaller lists require sacrifices</h2>
<p>Given that lengthy lists are unachievable, they need to be slimmed down to a manageable and realistic size. They need to be prioritized. <em>Prioritization</em> is an euphemism for <em>sacrificing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to want something, it’s hard to choose it against another desirable one.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>At the start of each year, I produce a small list of 3 to 4 high priority goals and 1 optional low priority goal of what I want to achieve by end of it, along with a small description on why I want them, and their impact. This takes several hours, sometimes days to put together, because of all the other ones that need to be left out.</p>

<p>Once the list is made though, it’s incredibly powerful due to it’s easy recall. This means that whenever I am faced with conflicting preferences, I can easily remember it and know in a snap what is the right thing to do. That is the real power behind that list. It’s guiding all the tiny small steps and decisions happening throughout the year, bringing me progressivily closer to those goals.</p>

<h2 id="the-question">The question</h2>
<p>The real question behind defining <em>knowing what we want</em> is actually <em>what we are willing to sacrifice</em>. Once the latter is defined and we are 100% convinced about it, then <em>knowing what we want</em> is bullet proof and easy to follow through. </p>

<p>What are you willing to sacrifice?</p>
