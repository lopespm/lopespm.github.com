    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined.</p>

  <p><em>― Yuval Noah Harari</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a minute to think of what a nation is. Let’s say the United States of America. What makes someone American? Is it their physique, genetic traits, family lineage, pheromones? No, it’s a concept in their head, which stems from a mix of identity, ideology, personal gains from abiding to that concept (say, gaining currency via a job or a company, that allows you to acquire things you desire), perceived protection and support from peers because they believe you are commonly aligned on core beliefs / concepts.</p>

<p>The same can be said of a company. A company is not a physical being, it’s a shared idea in our imagination. As Yuval mentions in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0099590085">Sapiens</a>, Peugeot does not really exist, except in our minds. It doesn’t have a body, mind, anything. We have the common belief that Peugeot exists, because we also have the common belief of what a company means, we are aligned on how it should be represented and who can represent it, we recognize it as an entity with rights and duties, and which laws it should abide by.</p>

<p>Laws, as well, are worth nothing if only one person believes in them. They are powerful because a large group of people believe in them, and they expect others to do so as well. That’s why we have courts, prisons, and educational systems for that matter. They are ways to punish, format, and incentivise for the entire group to have the required level of consistency, and keep rowing in the same direction.</p>

<p>That’s why complete anarchy loses its edge on a large scale. It extinguishes the biggest thing Humans have going for them: the ability for large numbers of people to rally in common goals, even though they don’t know personally most of their fellow believers.</p>

<p>As N. K. Humphrey suggests, these ideas, behaviors, or styles that spread by means of imitation from person to person within a culture, also known as memes, could even be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically. The generational propagation of a meme outweighs the lifespan of the Human who created it, so in a way, <em>“we are living inside the dreams of dead people”</em>, as Yuval puts it.</p>

<p>That being said, how do we align on a common concept or belief?</p>

<h2 id="stories">Stories</h2>

<p>We’ve seen from above how powerful and valuable having a broad range of concepts aligned within a group of people. They bring value to the whole, but also to the individual.</p>

<p>You can force someone to abide to a given concept via force (coercion, blackmailing, etc), but since they see little value going on for them, they don’t have the incentive to grow that concept inside them, or to propagate that concept to others</p>

<p>Stories however, allow you to describe a world to others that they can interpret in their head, and they can see by themselves how it would benefit them, and the ones around them. It’s an information passage mechanism that allows Humans to communicate and agree on a given concept, and they are everywhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Children’s bedtime stories - notice how several of these transmit moral values, this is, expectations of how one should behave in a given situation to be in alignment with the overall grpup / society</li>
  <li>Novels, biographies, movies</li>
  <li>When interviewees tell you a story of their childhood, how they created their company, how they achieved X, what happened during their struggles, etc</li>
  <li>When a leader, such as a CEO, convinces others of their vision / story, and that future prospects that would derive from working in a certain direction</li>
  <li>When meeting someone, when you talk about your background and your goals</li>
  <li>When you sell you employee skills to an employers, giving a summary of your professional trajectory</li>
  <li>When politicians portray their vision on how they want to improve their nation</li>
  <li>The lore of a nation, tribe, family, and their laws / duties / rights</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="being-a-good-storyteller-is-a-powerful-skill">Being a good storyteller is a powerful skill</h3>

<p>As a species, one of our biggest distinguishing factors is that we are able to goal on highly abstract concepts that only exist in our minds, such as the concept of a company, a nation, a mission, an ideology, an intellectual relationship, the concept of money. As Yuval puts it, <em>“We are the only species with the ability to use language—not just to describe things we can see, taste, and touch, but also to invent stories about things that don’t exist.”</em></p>

<p>A magical thing happens when a group of people interpret and value that concept in the same way, and are highly aligned on it. Narrative is the first and most crucial step for leaders who want to solve big problems and shape the world for the better. After all, a person can have the greatest idea in the world, but if they fail to rally others to make that idea come alive, nothing gets done.</p>

    <updated>2024-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/04/01/banishing_mobile_phones_from_bedroom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-problem--why">The Problem / Why</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://youtu.be/K2tGt2XWd9Q?si=h-xh-X90JWxwF1KU&amp;t=2229">asked</a> about which practices supported Chris Williamson into his current position, Chris mentioned that sleeping with his phone outside of the bedroom and getting a plain alarm clock was his number one change.</p>

<p>I found that statement interesting, especially because I had grown a habit of seeing the occasional video before sleep and being engaged with random distractions shortly after waking up.</p>

<p>Overriding these behaviors required a good amount of self discipline and willpower to be overridden, and fundamentally deviated my focus from what I would want to accomplish on a given day, from the book I had been putting off, or to simply wind down.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-alarm-and-note-taking">Alternative Alarm and Note Taking</h2>

<p>Even though my phone sponsored my distractions, it was also my trusty alarm and favorite way to write down notes and reflections that crossed my mind outside my work desk. So to make the leap of keeping my mobile phone at the bedroom door, I would need to replace the alarm clock, and find a new way to write down my notes.</p>

<h3 id="alarm">Alarm</h3>

<p>This seems like an easy step, but it turns out the selection of alarms is immense, and many of them either do too much, or don’t tick all the boxes.</p>

<p>Essentially, I needed a trustworthy, low maintenance, alarm with essential functionalities that would not flood my dark bedroom with blue light when I wanted to check the time during night.</p>

<p>I essentially browsed through:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.lumie.com/">Lumie alarms</a>: had the enticing proposition of science-backed approach of waking up via warm light or soothing sounds, but didn’t have the basic functionality of having recurrent alarms on the models I was interested in, and required a mains connection, meaning that upon a power outage it could only support itself for a limited amount of time.</li>
  <li>White brand alarm clocks: the selection is immense on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=alarm+clock">Amazon</a>, and even though they come in at relatively cheap prices, some require a mains connection, or have short battery life, or need to be recharged every so often, or do too much (like having a bluetooth connection) or use noisy clock dials.</li>
</ul>

<p>After several searches, I’ve stumbled upon Braun alarm clocks. These have been around for decades, and I recalled that Steve Jobs was inspired more than once by products made by Braun when creating his Apple products, due to Braun’s thoughtful approach on how everyday products were designed.</p>

<p>I’ve settled with the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Braun-Digital-Compact-Negative-Crescendo/dp/B083KMCHRH">Braun BC08B</a>. No moving parts, a single AAA battery apparently lasts more than half a year, small, simple, easy to operate, and the beeping sound is not brain drilling. The one aspect I am not fully satisfied is its screen light, which when activated is too strong on a dark bedroom (my mobile phone far excels in this aspect, due to its less intrusive always on black and white display).</p>

           </picture>
         </center>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="note-taking">Note Taking</h3>

<p>These were the alternatives I found for writing down notes, and jotting down diagrams (as a plus):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Notebook:
    <ul>
      <li>Pros: Easy to use, low cost, no distractions, low maintenance (no battery to recharge, software updates, etc)</li>
      <li>Cons: My handwriting is appalling and my character output is much lower when compared to typing; extra step needed to transfer it a digital means; harder to organize</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>E-Ink Devices:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://remarkable.com/">Remarkable 2</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: well thought out, clean and focus driven, great writing experience; allows for handwriting to text conversion</li>
          <li>Cons: Able to connect to a Google Drive for free, but works storage rather than syncing, so it is cumbersome to iterate on notes and diagrams between it and other devices</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://supernote.com/">Supernote</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: clean and focus driven, great writing experience; allows for handwriting to text conversion; open <a href="https://trello.com/b/l0COP24j/supernote-a5-x-a6-x-nomad-software-roadmap-2024">roadmap</a> and ideology; easy repair and upgrade</li>
          <li>Cons: As with Remarkable, it does not provide real file syncing, but file copy to Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B">Kindle Scribe</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: Writing experience seems to be good and on-device handwriting recognition to convert notes into actual text</li>
          <li>Cons: No Google Play apps, meaning that Google Keep and Google Docs would not be available, and no Google Drive sync; the device caters more to readers, rather than writers in my opinion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air3-ePaper/dp/B0CP3CGG8P">Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: it can use Google Keep and Google Docs apps, since can do almost everything a normal Android table can, but since it uses a e-ink screen and has limited processing capabilities, it does not make a good fit for browsing the web or seeing videos (which is actually a good thing); the default experience and drawing app are bloated offer too many distractions (<a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/03/25/minimalist_boox.html">see here how to debloat it</a>); allows for handwriting to text conversion within Onyx drawing app</li>
          <li>Cons: noticeable lag when writing; if not using Onyx’s cloud, it requires extra steps to export and share a diagram / drawing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>: even though this device is amazing, it made it too easy to access the same distractions I was trying to avoid, and it also sports an invasive backlit screen that provides too much stimulus while in bed. A hard no.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the options above, I picked the Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W. Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air-ePaper-Dark-grey-green/dp/B0CHF423CP">color screen version of this tablet</a> is available, but I did not pick it because of Air C’s reduced battery life from the always-on BSR (Boox Super Refresh Technology). BSR allows for a smoother and more responsive experience when writing for example, but that is not actually a problem since I mainly use the Boox to write long streams of text / braindumps, rather than text editing; and BSR also takes it a step closer to a general purpose tablet non-eink display, which starts to defeat the initial purpose. Apart from that, I have a personal preference towards the black and white screen feel.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>

<p>I have now transitioned to not having any mobile phones in my bedroom, and only having the Boox Air 3, the Braun alarm clock, physical books and my Kindle. I am pretty satisfied with this change, which I’ve noticed to provide more focus time after waking up, more time to think, plan my day, reflect, write my thoughts, read, and wind down.</p>

<p>The most fundamental aspect was having more time to focus on my plan for the day, which translated into a substantial improvement on how productive and consequential my days have become. I welcome anyone to give it a try!</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/03/25/minimalist_boox.html"/>
    <updated>2024-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/03/25/minimalist_boox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/04/01/banishing_mobile_phones_from_bedroom.html">plan to banish mobile phones with access to instant rewards from my bedroom</a>, I’ve acquired a Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W, which is a Android tablet with a black and white e-ink screen that is focused on writing and reading <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="house-rules">House Rules</h2>

<p>First of all, <em>why</em> I did get the device in the first place? This was in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce distractions before going to sleep and after waking up, increase focus on the things that really mattered, block out all other noise, and make it really hard to have access to instant gratification and rewards (such as video consumption)</li>
  <li>Register any ideas and thoughts that occur to me before and after going to sleep, which is one of my most proficuous times for such, and then have them available on other devices</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How</em> to achieve this using the BOOX:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only two functionalities should be easy and quick to use:
    <ul>
      <li>Write text and notes (via Google Keep and Google Docs)</li>
      <li>Write diagrams and mental maps (via the device’s main app, which has the snappiest performance)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Getting to above functionalities should be as fast as possible, and they should be fast</li>
  <li>The cost to get to other apps and functionalities should be high</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="focusing--debloating">Focusing &amp; Debloating</h2>

<p>The Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W is not an incredibly fast device, and comes with several functionalities, apps, and a launcher that increase the distraction degree, and also slow down the device.</p>

<h3 id="google-play-google-keep--docs">Google Play, Google Keep &amp; Docs</h3>

<p>The first step towards the objective above was to install Google Play (see <a href="https://help.boox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8569260963732-Google-Play-Store">guide here</a>, and afterwards installed these apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Keep</li>
  <li>Google Docs</li>
  <li>Android Hidden Settings - this app provides access to several hidden settings, that allow the access of settings such as enabling the Developer Options in Android (useful in the debloating process described below)</li>
  <li>Lawnchair (see below)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-launcher-lawnchair">New Launcher: Lawnchair</h3>

</div>
</center>

<p>The default device’s launcher was replaced by <a href="https://lawnchair.app/">Lawnchair</a>, which is a lightweight, open-source, highly customizable launcher for Android.</p>

<p>What was added to the Lawnchair’s home screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Keep</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Docs</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Onyx Launcher - for any custom changes that are only accessible on the device’s default launcher, which are are in practice, so this was eventually something I removed from the home screen as I wrote this note</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Calendar - to add any events or reminders</li>
  <li>A widget to Onyx Sketch app, which is one the only way I found to have that app directly accessible from the Lawnchair home screen, without having to use Onyx’s launcher to do so. The widget can be added by long pressing on the home screen, then select “Widgets”, and then on the “ContentBrowser” section select one of the “Notes” widgets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disabling-bloatware">Disabling bloatware</h3>

<p>With all of the above in place, we could start disabling non-essential apps and services, to prevent them from running in the background.</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step is to enable “Developer Options”, by accessing the system settings via the “Android Hidden Settings” app above, and then finding the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options">Build Number</a> in order to click it enough times to eventually enable “Developer Options”.</li>
  <li>Connect the BOOX to the computer</li>
  <li>On the computer’s terminal run the below commands</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, these are the commands one can run via the terminal to manage bloat apps:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>// See all packages
$ adb shell pm list packages

// See all disabled packages
$ adb shell pm list packages -d

// Disable a package
$ adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 &lt;package_to_disable&gt;

// Re-enable a package
$ adb shell pm enable &lt;package_to_disable&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br />
And these are the specific ones I used in my BOOX to disable bloatware, without any relevant side effects for my usages:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.appmarket
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.floatingbutton
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.dict
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.mail
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.igetshop
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.easytransfer
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.kime
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.android.ksync
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.calculator
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The commands above should be enough to remove all bloatware, and if you wish to learn more, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/how-to-disable-and-remove-android-bloatware/26993/">this article</a> and <a href="https://digitaluncoded.com/cpu-usage-android">this article</a> provide a good overview.</p>

<h2 id="using-an-external-keyboard">Using an external keyboard</h2>

<p>Given that this device is meant to be used in bed, and since it is quite unwieldy to write on the on-screen display, I was looking for an external keyboard that could be somehow attached to the BOOX, that would bestable, low-maintenance and allowed for flexibility on the writing position.</p>

<p>From the keyboards and keyboard stands I’ve researched, the most elegant solution I found was to use <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/keyboards/k480-multi-device-wireless.html">Logitech K480</a>, a bluetooth keyboard with an in-built cradle, detachable batteries (i.e. zero issues related internal battery becoming faulty), incredible battery span (some users reported this to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoH2bXoNEE0">in the order of years</a>), and wonderful typing experience.</p>

<p>One caveat is that the BOOX slides backward and falls when using the cradle without any other aid. A very simple fix is to get a piece of cardboard, and place it behind the BOOX (see picture below) to create a better fit. It works remarkably well.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="writing-and-drawing">Writing and Drawing</h2>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>Writing is my main use case for the device, and even though it has some lag when doing it, it works great for me, because I tend to write long streams of ranting text, rather than editing it.</p>

<div>
	<div class="youtube-player" data-id="bYENTrabzXw" data-thumbsize="1"></div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The best mode I’ve found for writing was the “A2” Mode. It has ghosting, but is responsive enough for this use case.</p>

<p>To draw, I use the default Onyx’s Sketch app due to its responsiveness, even though I would have preferred to have a more customizable UI interface and faster ways to share the drawing.</p>

<p>Sharing is one of the downsides of the Onyx Sketch app. You need to either use their cloud service, or export the image in order to get the sketch easily accessible on other devices. I’ve opted to use the export functionality, which allows to directly share the image to a Google Keep note, which fits well into my workflow. I would prefer to not have this extra step, but still, it works well enough.</p>

<p>This has been one of the most satisfying devices I’ve added to my routines, and it’s incredibly satisfying to write on this device, almost distraction free. It allows enough customizability for it to be tailored to my use case, but is also limited enough to deter me from falling prey to distractions.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful towards your journey - do let me know your tips for distraction free environments!</p>

    <updated>2024-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/02/18/elon_musk_biography</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been hearing the <a href="https://amzn.to/3I97bBi">latest Elon Musk biography</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on audiobook, and just like Ashlee Vance’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3I5hUNu">book</a><sup>1</sup>, I’m finding it incredibly interesting. Here’s why:</p>

<h2 id="possibilities-monty-python-costs-whys-and-whos">Possibilities, Monty Python, costs, whys and whos</h2>

<h3 id="the-action-on-potential">The action on potential</h3>

<p>I find his path inspiring. It makes me want to create and do things, and shows that many things that are thought to be impossible, are actually achievable. There is a whole realm of opportunities waiting to be grabbed, and his life demonstrates just that.</p>

<p>There is a cost though. If it were that easy, everyone would do it.</p>

<h3 id="the-defining-characteristics">The defining characteristics</h3>

<p>The book goes deeper into the unique aspects that allow Musk to be an extreme overachiever, but also the personal and professional costs those same aspects inflict.</p>

<p>Musk’s capacity to take pain, risk, stress and adversity is staggering. I’ve been reading several biographies over the past years and met quite a few people throughout my life. I can only find a handful of them that are even comparable.</p>

<p>The relentless pursuit, sometimes maniacal, of product quality, functional and non-wasteful design, and effective manufacturing. All in the name of a greater objective, larger than any single human being or corporation.</p>

<h3 id="the-relationships">The relationships</h3>

<p>The book dives into the relationships that shaped Musk (for the better, for the worse, or both), the types of relationships he consistently attracted (which resonated with his personality and upbringing), and essential relationships that allowed him and his projects to thrive.</p>

<p>They come to further prove that no man or woman is an island. You can’t succeed by your own.</p>

<h3 id="the-humor">The humor</h3>

<p>Consistently throughout Musk’s life, there is a balance between dark and light, between lighthearted comedy and downright hell.</p>

<p>I’ve had a good laugh with some of the humorous sides though, such as when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grA5XmBRC6g">eels and hovercrafts</a> were catered to one of his marriages, or when Blue Origin filed a formal protest against SpaceX to prevent the company from having exclusive use of a NASA launchpad, to which Musk <a href="https://spacenews.com/37389musk-calls-out-blue-origin-ula-for-phony-blocking-tactic-on-shuttle-pad/">replied</a> that <em>“if they do somehow show up in the next  5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs. Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.”</em></p>

<p>Shortly after, a SpaceX employee bought dozens of inflatable unicorns and took a picture of them standing in a flame duct 🦄</p>

<h2 id="musks-algorithm">Musk’s algorithm</h2>

<p><em>“The Algorithm”</em>, is a distillation of lessons learned while relentlessly increasing production capacity, which Musk repeatedly preached on his enterprises:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Question every requirement</li>
  <li>Delete any part of the process you can</li>
  <li>Simplify and optimize</li>
  <li>Accelerate cycle time</li>
  <li>Automate</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="questioning-requirements">1. Questioning requirements</h3>

<p>It can be summarized into this: <em>“The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.”</em>. It’s a recurrent theme.</p>

<p>Doesn’t come without a cost though: it is often associated with conflict and chaos.</p>

<h3 id="about-2-delete-any-part-of-the-process-you-can">About 2. Delete any part of the process you can</h3>

<p><em>“Delete, delete, delete”</em></p>

<p>Optimization many times goes hand in hand with deletion. Deleting is hard. It requires letting go of past achievements, comfort, and acceptance that something is not coming back. Almost like a breakup.</p>

<h3 id="simplify-and-optimize">3. Simplify and optimize</h3>

<p>Goes hand in hand with deletion.</p>

<h3 id="accelerate-cycle-time">4. Accelerate cycle time</h3>

<p>This is where intensity and being “hard core” are most leveraged, in my view. Again, with their pros and cons.</p>

<h3 id="automate">5. Automate</h3>

<p>A more obvious one. Put a machine to do it. Easier said than done though.</p>

<h2 id="data-points---cause--effect-probabilities">Data points -&gt; cause &amp; effect probabilities</h2>

<p>I’m fond of biographies because they provide several data points that I can later use in my life. This is, which set of actions preceded a given consequence. Of course the context matters, and surely no same action will lead to the same consequence, specially if made by different people.</p>

<p>But patterns start to emerge, and their respective probabilities. These help me solidify my own personal theories and strategies. Learning from others is important. It allows for “shortcuts” similar to the ones provided by good mentors.</p>

<p>To build these, I need data points, a lot of them.</p>

<p>That is why I like Isaacson’s biographies so much <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This is this third book I read (or hear) from Walter Isaacson, and one of the things I enjoy most about his writing is how deep he goes into the details of someone’s story. I believe that details are important when portraying someone’s life. Sometimes, the smallest of events make an immense difference over someone’s path.</p>

<h2 id="just-read--hear-it">Just read / hear it</h2>

<p>Love him, or hate him, I recommend Musk’s biography to just about anyone.</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/01/27/project_planning_framework.html"/>
    <updated>2024-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/01/27/project_planning_framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Different goals require different roadmapping and planning techniques.</p>

<p>In this post, a simple framework is proposed to classify a goal using three axes, in order to inform the approach taken towards reaching that goal. The three axes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: how much leeway is there to extend the deadline to deliver a goal?</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: how many steps are needed to reach the goal?</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: how sure are we that a given step will move us toward the goal?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-of-how-to-apply-the-framework">Example of how to apply the Framework</h2>

<h3 id="scenario-1-reach-compliance">Scenario 1: Reach Compliance</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>An external entity (let’s say, government or partner company), has made a set of requirements for which your team must provide compliance for on a fixed, non-negotiable timeline, with limited team capacity. The “definition of done” is well defined by this entity, and there is a low amount of unknowns of how to reach the goals.</p>

<h4 id="axes">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: High</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: Low</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>

<p>This goal has sensitive timelines and is archetypal top-down. The deadline will be reached in one way or the other, so all hands are needed on deck to tackle this goal. In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a Gant-style chart, where there is a heavy emphasis on the timeline</li>
  <li>Apply stricter project management, more process driven</li>
</ul>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/compliance.webp" aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance" />
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/compliance.png" aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance" />
             <img src="https://lopespm.com/files/project_planning_framework/compliance.png" aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance" />
           </picture>
         </center>

<h3 id="scenario-2-increase-effectiveness-of-a-user-flow">Scenario 2: Increase Effectiveness of a User Flow</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement-1">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>Your team supports a user flow, such as a check-out flow, for which the goal is the increase the conversion amount by <em>X</em>. There are known levers you have available to drive this metric, but also many others which are unbeknownst and would need experimentation and research. This increase is not business critical, so there is an underlying lenience in case the goal is not hit.</p>

<h4 id="axes-1">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: High</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach-1">Approach</h4>

<p>Unlike Scenario 1, which is exploitation heavy, this scenario favors an approach which is exploration heavy, due to the high amount of uncertainty of which projects will be able to move the needle towards the successful completion of the goal. To de-risk and address this goal, a high level of adaptability will be needed, and several opportunities will need to be created to discover which levers can be used. In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have open ended brainstorming sessions</li>
  <li>Leverage user research and focus groups</li>
  <li>Apply looser project management, to allow for quick and less trashier pivots</li>
</ul>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Project planning diagram for increasing effectiveness">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/effectiveness.webp" aria-label="Project planning diagram for increasing effectiveness" />

             <img src="https://lopespm.com/files/project_planning_framework/effectiveness.png" aria-label="Project planning diagram for increasing effectiveness" />
           </picture>
         </center>

<h3 id="scenario-3-unification-of-several-systems-into-one">Scenario 3: Unification of Several Systems into One</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement-2">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>Your team is tasked to unify several internal systems into a single one, where several dependencies between different projects exist, and the time each project will take ranges from certain to unknown.</p>

<h4 id="axes-2">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: High</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: Low / Medium</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach-2">Approach</h4>

<p>The focus here should be on making clear which are the dependencies between different projects, and allow some leniency towards the completion of each of the projects, while actively managing the team’s capacity to focus on the projects which are discovered to require a heavier lift. In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a full dependency graph, allowing for each of the projects timelines to have some leeway where needed</li>
  <li>Incentivize structured system design documents and discussions, making sure that all involved parties are aligned on a given approach, and engineers are able to explain not only the system they own, but also other systems involved in their unification</li>
</ul>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Project planning diagram for unification of systems">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/unification.webp" aria-label="Project planning diagram for unification of systems" />
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/unification.png" aria-label="Project planning diagram for unification of systems" />

           </picture>
         </center>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>The framework above is quite simple and could potentially be used for several other different use cases. It might also be missing some essential parameters that are relevant for your specific context. Let me know if you find these, I would be happy to review the framework accordingly. Regardless, hope the above can be useful on your next roadmapping / planning cycle!</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/12/31/meme-transcending-host.html"/>
    <updated>2023-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/12/31/meme-transcending-host</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is an ephemeral nature to everything. That includes me, you and this blog. This blog is currently <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/lopespm.github.com">hosted in GitHub</a>, and nothing guarantees that after I’m long gone, or even before, GitHub might cease to exist. How to account for that?</p>

<p>One way to keep these writings alive, would be to assign a third person with the task of keeping this establishment online. What happens when that person is gone though? It’s turtles all the way down.</p>

<p>Another way would be to find a self sustainable digital mechanism to keep this blog alive, ie, a bot. That has its own issues as well, since technologies change and distributed systems like <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> come and go.</p>

<p>The other option to extend the lifespan of these digital contents is to have these writings persisted into a physical medium. A book. No maintenance required. As long as it can be kept safe from unfortunate <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning">book burning events</a>, the probability that a single copy remains alive, and can be made accessible (such as a public library) to someone and hopefully improve their life, increases.</p>

<h2 id="no-input-no-output">No Input, No Output</h2>

<p>The jump from a humble blog to a book is quite a leap. Outrageous even. Perhaps doable.</p>

<p>Some of the books I’ve recently read gave me some guidance and ideas on how to take that germinal idea into fruition (<em>note that the following links are affiliate links, and as an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases whose commissions help this small establishment, <u>at no additional cost to you</u></em>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rolf Dobelli’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3NJ12is">The Art of the Good Life</a> is a collection of 52 articles that Dobelli wrote for a newspaper column.</li>
  <li>Dobelli also previously wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/3NGItvC">The Art of Thinking Clearly</a> (I did not read this one), which reveals the most common errors of judgment, and how to avoid them, throughout 99 short chapters. Although the idea the idea of 99 chapters seems to have been <a href="https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/dobelli.htm">original to Nassim Taleb’s</a> project to publish “99 (convex) heuristics”</li>
  <li>Steven Bartlett shares on his <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbDNas">Diary of a CEO book</a> that at 21 years old, he made a promise to himself that every day at 7PM, he would write a tweet or make a video delivering a single idea, and then post it online at 8PM, which Steven claims to have been the habit the most difference to advance his knowledge and skills. It completely changed his life trajectory, and consequently it’s the piece of advice Steven most strongly urges for anyone looking to be a better thinker, speaker, writer, or content creator. The key here was that he made it a daily obligation, not just an interest.
    <ul>
      <li>From this, I assume that this habit was foundational to his <a href="https://stevenbartlett.com/the-diary-of-a-ceo-podcast/">Diary of a CEO podcast</a>, which eventually resulted in the book above</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After listening to <a href="https://amzn.to/3GYxlq6">Benjamin Franklin’s biography</a> on audiobook, I’ve came to learn that not only was Franklin a statesman, diplomat, scientist and inventor, but also a prolific writer, printer and publisher, which were unbeknownst to me. As a publisher, Benjamin Franklin wrote several dissertations and essays <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (such as the ones under the pen name of Silence Dogood), which I’m sure to have fed into Franklin’s books, which brought many interesting ideas to a large population, like his own <a href="https://amzn.to/4aG58ly">autobiography</a>, which could be seen as a compilation of several of his ideas and reflections / writings (these go hand in hand).</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from finding the above points inspirational, they also make me think that creating a discipline where I consistently share my reflections and experiences via writing or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VHNCq3yGJrLn82VsdONOg">videos</a>, not only helps me <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking.html">solidify my thoughts</a> and provides more immediate feedback on how valuable these are to its viewers / readers (which allows me to course correct and iterate <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>), but also provides the building blocks to put together a hopefully meaningful and concise book to help surpass the limited lifespan of the digital medium that hosts this blog and my YouTube videos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No Input, No Output</p>

  <p><em>― Joe Strummer, lead singer of The Clash</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-path-towards-physical-persistence">The Path Towards Physical Persistence</h2>

<p>Given the above, here are some action points to put the wheels in motion towards building “physical persistence” via a book, and give better chances for its memes to transcend their host <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My low priority 2024 <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html">goal</a> is continuing to publish blog notes and videos. The numeric goal I’ve set for myself is to publish 12 blog notes, about once per month. From these, make the respective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VHNCq3yGJrLn82VsdONOg">YouTube videos</a>, but this would be a stretch sub-goal (albeit, one that I really enjoy)
    <ul>
      <li>This was a consequence of my recent “personal performance” review for this year’s personal goals, which was a good opportunity to reflect on what went well, what went less well, what was achieved, and what was missed. One of the aspects that I aim to implement for the <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html">upcoming year’s goals</a> is to use numeric goals, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once 50 or 99 meaningful blog notes are written, attempt to compile them into a book.
    <ul>
      <li>Why 50 or 99? Upon reaching 50 notes, I might feel that not enough substantial content was generated to be distilled into a book. Once 99 notes are reached however, it would be more certain that enough meaningful content was accumulated (hopefully). I would expect the distillation process to remove several notes that would be deemed to have less quality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Looking forward to 2024! 🎉</p>

</div>

<p>I was recently in NYC. It was one of the most interesting experiences I’ve ever had.</p>

<p>Each one has their own perspectives when visiting the city, and I’ve asked several people about theirs before the trip, which helped immensely when planning out my itinerary. Now it’s my time to pay it forward. Here is my guide / personal perspective of New York.</p>

<h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>

<p>Having a pre-curated list of points of interest on Google Maps was one of the most useful and time efficient aspects of the entire trip. This allowed me to quickly improvise and make the most of my surroundings, since I could just look at the map to check which nearby places I could visit at any given time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/e6z91pon4Lco8r6F8">Points of Interest Map</a></li>

<h2 id="museums">Museums</h2>

<p>I didn’t consider myself to be an excessive photographer. I’ve discovered on this trip that I was probably wrong. I can’t recall the last time I took so many photos, it was like I was in an outstanding candy store of visual goodies.</p>

<h3 id="intrepid-museum">Intrepid Museum</h3>

<p>Let’s start with fashion. I’ve been pointed out that my glasses make me look nerdy / square / too serious / too much like an engineer. Well, thanks to this museum piece, I can now say they were developed for space walks:</p>

<p>Oh, and look back and you will also see the Space Shuttle <em>Enterprise</em>, the first orbiter of the Space Shuttle system:</p>

<p>You can find these glasses, the space shuttle, sit inside the Mercury capsule or A-6 Intruder cockpit, see real life jet planes like the Lockheed A-12, in the Intrepid museum.</p>

<p>Where is the Intrepid museum? The museum is an World War II–era aircraft carrier. Yes, the vessel <em>is</em> the museum. You can explore several of it’s interior sections, including the bridge, living quarters, gun and bomb bays, go through the same narrow escalator that pilots took to the flight deck, all of these throughout several floors and different explorable rooms</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide" style="background-image: url('/files/nyc/pPXL_20231210_154908796_2.jpg')"></div>

</div>

<p>Right beside the Intrepid lies USS Growler, a diesel powered submarine retrofitted to deliver Regulus nuclear missiles, as a form of nuclear deterrence during Cold War. You can go inside the submarine and get an intimate experience of how it’s lived throughout their 2 month patrols, where they faced the constant scenario of being called upon to launch a nuclear missile onto Russian soil, destroying not only their target, but most likely kill themselves on the process, since the process to launching / reloading Regulus missiles was long and would expose this submarine to enemy reconnaissance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since it was a diesel submarine, it required to be at surface or near surface level (it was not possible to push out their exhaust gasses when deep in the ocean) to enable a set of its 3 engines to charge its on-board batteries that would power the submarine and its electric motors.</li>
  <li>It also needed to be periodically refueled, so the submarine ran a long circular patrol in the Pacific Ocean to refuel to eventually sit near Russian enemy lines for dozens of days.</li>
  <li>The crew had to maintain absolute secrecy about their mission, and none of their partners knew the context of it</li>
  <li>The families of the crew members knew nothing about their mission, and that if they did launch a nuclear missile, they would be exposed, and most likely be killed as they expose themselves to launch the nuclear load (not to mention the annihilation that comes from the nuclear warhead)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found the underlying story and details of this submarine and this mission to be so interesting, that right after the tour, I went immediately in search of staff members to ask a series of questions that came about during the visit. They very kindly and patiently took the time to answer them, and one of the ladies even asked me if I was an engineer. I’m not sure what gave that away. It was either the questions, or my glasses :)</p>

<h3 id="met">MET</h3>

<p>MET, or Metropolitan Museum of Art, has two locations: the museum in Fifth Avenue is the most famous one and is often referred to when mentioning MET. The other lesser known branch is in Upper Manhattan, the MET Cloisters.</p>

<h4 id="met-fifth-avenue">MET: Fifth Avenue</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you like the British Museum, you will love MET on Fifth Avenue</li>
  <li>They reconstructed the 10 BCE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Dendur">Temple of Dendur</a> Roman Egyptian religious structure, which was originally located in Tuzis (later Dendur). Must I say more?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>This massive museum spans through classical antiquity and ancient Egypt; paintings and sculptures from nearly all the European masters; and an extensive collection of American and modern art. All of these are intertwined with large thematic rooms where the installations are beautiful to behold. If you are going to see a single museum in New York, this should be the one.</li>

<p>One of the last books I’ve listen on audiobook was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-American-Walter-Isaacson/dp/074325807X">Walter Isaacson’s Benjamin Franklin biography</a>, where one of passages goes through the story of how a Duplessis’ painting of Franklyn’s portrait came to be. This <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436236?pkgids=367&amp;pos=1&amp;nextInternalLocale=en&amp;ft=*&amp;oid=436236&amp;rpp=4&amp;exhibitionId=%7Bfc6dc1eb-bea2-4986-afc2-1cd8b02db3ee%7D&amp;pg=1">1778 painting can be seen in the museum</a>, and curiously enough, Franklyn’s depiction on <a href="https://www.uscurrency.gov/denominations/100"><span>$</span>100 bills from 1914 to 1990</a> had him wearing a fur coat, just like this painting.</p>

<h4 id="met-cloisters">MET: Cloisters</h4>

<p>With the same ticket, one can visit the Cloisters and the 5th Avenue museum on the same day. The Cloisters museum is America’s only museum dedicated exclusively to the art and architecture of the Middle Ages, and is smaller than the 5th Avenue one. Still there much to explore not only inside the museum, but also on its surroundings</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">

<h3 id="national-history-museum">National History Museum</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I lost count of the amount of dinosaur skeletons I’ve seen in the natural history museum. And nothing quite prepares you to see a gigantic skeleton of a Titanosaur. It’s so big that its head extends outside of its new home in the Museum’s fourth-floor gallery.</li>
  <li>I’ve learned while browsing the museum about mass dinosaur graves and their relationship to draughts, and went through thought provoking sections, such as the presentation of a massive turtle specimen, that if it were to be extinct it would probably be right part of our imaginary and event movies.</li>
</ul>

<p>On Saturdays, from 5 to 8 pm, admission to the museum is “Pay What You Wish”, for a minimum of <span>$</span>1. I would recommend doing so, since the museum can be easily visited in less than one hour, and in my opinion, it’s more about the building than the pieces themselves</p>

<h3 id="broadway">Broadway</h3>

<p>Broadway shows are a hallmark of NYC, although if you are from London or Europe, I would recommend not seeing shows that are already available in London. For example, I’ve heard that Hamilton is better seen in London, due to the larger contextual part that King George has in the UK.</p>

<p>The Chicago musical is a good bet, and is the one I’ve attended to, it is the second longest-running show ever to run on Broadway, behind only The Phantom of the Opera</p>

<h3 id="comedy">Comedy</h3>

<p>Comedy Cellar is a comedy club in Manhattan where many top New York comedians perform, and where several comedians started, like Louis C.K. or Dave Chappelle. I found it be have down to earth, edgy comedy, and you are asked to leave your phone in a pouch, which I believe to increase presence of the entire crowd, but also provides extra freedom to comedians, given to how powerful cancel culture can be</p>

<h2 id="points-of-interest">Points of Interest</h2>

<h3 id="statue-of-liberty">Statue of Liberty</h3>

<p>You can get the Staten Island Ferry from the Whitehall terminal, for <em>free</em>. On your way to the terminal, several people will try to sell and cajole you into payed trips to the Statue of Liberty trips. The ferry is more than enough.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ferry runs <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/ferrybus/siferryschedule.shtml">every 30 minutes</a>, 24 hours per day, for most of the days, and travel time is approximately 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Once you get to Staten Island, you can either take some time to explore it, or just return immediately to Manhattan, by exiting the ferry, by entering St. George’s Ferry Terminal, and entering the boarding gates for the next ferry.</li>
  <li>When entering the Whitehall terminal, enter through the right side of the ferry in order to be on the same side that the Statue of Liberty will appear. If entering on St. George’s Ferry Terminal, enter through the left side of the ferry. Regardless, you can easily change sides when inside the ferry</li>
  <li>Most of the people will likely go to the top floor with larger windows, which will eventually get crowded. I recommend instead to take the bottom floor, and find a window that is already opened. The view is much clearer (since you don’t have a worn down piece of glass obfuscating the view), you can sit comfortably near the window, and you won’t need to fight a crowd (in principle)</li>

<p>Central Park is an urban park between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City that was the first landscaped park in the United States.

<p>Upon the southern end of the High Line park, you can view Little Island, and quickly walk to it. Little Island is an artificial island park, with some beautiful views and interesting layout</p>

Those same brokers and traders are now surrounded by computers that manage the majority of the buying and selling of stocks for their various accounts. Floor trading still exists, but it is responsible for a rapidly diminishing share of market activity.</li>
  <li>The Charging Bull of Wall Street is not really located on Wall Street itself, but it is quite near. The bull in finance represents optimism and growth. The statue on Wall Street represents the same ideas.</li>
  <li>The Federal Hall is a historic building, whose original building served as New York’s first City Hall and hosted the 1765 Stamp Act Congress before the American Revolution. With the establishment of the United States federal government in 1789, it was renamed Federal Hall, as it hosted the 1st Congress and was where George Washington was sworn in as the nation’s first president. The current structure was built as the U.S. Custom House for the Port of New York before serving as a Subtreasury building from 1862 to 1925, and the current national memorial commemorates the historic events that occurred at the previous structure.</li>

<h3 id="citigroup-center">Citigroup Center</h3>

<p>Due to material changes during construction, the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/z4F9FgXe4QfVZvux5">building</a> as initially completed was structurally unsound. To save money, Bethlehem Steel changed the plans in 1974 to use bolted joints, and wind loads were calculated from perpendicular winds, as required under the building code; in typical buildings, loads from quartering winds at the corners would be less.</p>

<p>In June 1978, after an inquiry from an engineering student, the structural engineer recalculated the wind loads on the building with quartering winds, and found these to significantly increase the load at the bolted joints, and that a wind capable of toppling Citicorp Center would occur every 55 years on average.</p>

<p>Starting in August 1978, construction crews covertly fixed the issue, and six weeks into the work, a major storm was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. The reinforcement was only half-finished, with New York City hours away from emergency evacuation. The storm eventually turned eastward and veered out to sea.

<h3 id="the-woolworth-building">The Woolworth Building</h3>

<p>Completed in 1912, the Woolworth Building was the tallest building in the world from 1913 to 1930, with a height of 241 meters. It blows my mind that such a tall building was built more than 100 years ago.</p>

<p>The first picture on this note was taken at the “Joker Stairs”, which is the colloquial name for a step street connecting Shakespeare and Anderson avenues at West 167th Street in the Highbridge neighborhood. The stairs are quite different from when Joaquin Phoenix danced as the Joker. They are more colorful, and have a construction site ongoing at the top.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Brooklyn Museum is New York City’s second largest and contains an art collection with around 500,000 objects, and  is fairly easy to access from the subway. The breadth and depth of objects at the Brooklyn Museum is best compared to the Met, boasting strong departments of both Western and non-Western holdings. I didn’t fit enough time to visit the actual museum, but it is definitely on the todo list in case I visit the city again.</li>
  <li>Brooklyn’s Library four stories high main entrance is a marvel to behold just by itself</li>

<h3 id="where-to-eat">Where to Eat</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Unless you would be aiming to hit a specific high demand restaurant at a specific time span, there is limited need to pre-book a restaurant, since you can just walk for a few minutes and find other quality restaurants.</li>
  <li>There are several food stalls around NYC, many of which you will be able to recognize by their LED letterings and smell of burnt meat, I would personally avoid these. There are food stalls which are incredible though. One of these is <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/M9xwJBkt5n1bpkY87">Shawarma Bay</a>, just a block away from Radio City Music Hall. Incredible food, although it can gain quite a queue, which can take about 30 minutes, as it was my case. Worth the wait though– cops were eating there</li>
  <li>You can get incredibly good Deli Sandwiches in NYC, in places such as <a href="https://g.co/kgs/eXxHUA">Sunny &amp; Annie’s Deli</a>. I’ve personally tried one at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qKFMoUoXPdT9qSgg7">Gold Deli</a>, and it was seriously good.</li>
  <li>Are you in Times Square and want to grab a bite? Walk 2 blocks west and you will find yourself in Hell’s Kitchen, packed with good restaurants, without much less hassle</li>
  <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DDbPvmqBeturoA219">Wan Wan</a> Thai restaurant was the best dining experience I had in NYC, for an acceptable price.</li>

  <li>Williamsburg’s L’Industrie Pizzeria apparently has some of the best pizzas in NYC, but I can’t attest to that, given there was a massive queue when I arrived there. So I moved to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rosa's+Pizza/@40.7139722,-73.9582738,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c259438227569b:0x1ad684baf4902574!8m2!3d40.7139722!4d-73.9556935!16s%2Fg%2F11grts6bbq?entry=ttu">Rosa’s Pizza</a>, where I had delicious slice.</li>

<h3 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This all depends on your budget, activities you would like to do, who is going with you, etc. But in general, I would advise on staying in Manhattan island, or at least near to a transport connection that can get you quickly to the city center, since it is where most of the points of interest are located, and transport links are quite good from there. Most likely you will also be in your lodging to sleep, and not much else.</li>
  <li>If looking for a hostel, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2EjoFJnZMMGqhC8N7">HI New York City Hostel</a> is a good one. It even sports free weekly comedy sessions every Sunday night. It’s located near Central Park, and you can’t go wrong with this one. In general, you can search through https://www.hostelworld.com/ and book through there, it was quite reliable for the two bookings I did.</li>
  <li>If looking for something more comfortable, citizenM Hotels are of incredible good value and location. Apart from the comfortable rooms that have nice view already, on Bowery it even has rooftop terrace with an amazing view of the city</li>

</div>

<h3 id="money--how-to-pay">Money / How to Pay</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stores, food establishments (even chains), bodegas / delis, 7-11s, etc present their prices as pre-tax. New York City sales tax ranges from 4% to 8.875%, and <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/listings_of_taxable_and_exempt_food.htm">some products are exempt from it</a>.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to tip everywhere. On restaurants it is customary to tip 20%. There is some debate about whether you should calculate the tip on the amount before or after tax.</li>
  <li>You don’t really need cash. You do need it if you want to buy from street vendors, or if you want to dodge the additional cost that certain sellers impose on card transactions (like the shawarma above)  </li>
  <li>On restaurants and entertainment venues, it is common practice for the attendant to leave with the credit card, to later return with an attached invoice that is meant to be signed and filled with the tipping amount.
    <ul>
      <li>It also happened to me that when trying to pay by contactless card to a market vendor, the card kept being rejected, and since the card insertion feature was not available, the vendor wrote down the card number and details into the system to proceed with the payment. That failed as well, because the card got blocked by my bank due to a false-positive suspected fraud, as I later discovered. Eventually I just payed with cash to resolve the issue.</li>
      <li>As an European, the practice of being physically separated from the card, verification via signature, and freely writing down credit card numbers strike me as quite unsecure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="getting-around--transportation">Getting Around / Transportation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Walking is one of the best ways to discover the city. Sidewalks are broad, the city is grid shaped (so expect to be given coordinates in the form of street / avenue to pinpoint a place), and pedestrian lights and timings ran standard everywhere I visited. The large majority of my city exploration was made over the span of 180km, throughout 4 days. Extra tip: if you are used to barefoot shoes, wearing <a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/rw/">firm ground outsole Vivos</a> to do so is amazing. My feet were sore, but happy.</li>
  <li>Walking through the perpendicular numbered streets and avenues is an absolute bliss, and makes it quite easy to navigate through them. Several times I just looked at the map and quickly memorized something like “3 right, 2 left”, which translated to “cross 3 roads and turn right, and then cross 2 roads and turn left”. This would keep me walking going for a long time and have time to appreciate the surroundings, without the need to constantly check the map.</li>
  <li>Ferry boats are a great way to sight the city, for a low price (<span>$</span>4 for a one way-ticket), and you can buy these tickets through the NYC Ferry app or a ticket vending machine.</li>
  <li>Subway and Bus now have OMNI, which just means that you can tap in with your credit / debit card. Each ride costs <span>$</span>2.90, and there are no different prices for different zones. This has a [rolling 7 day price cap] (https://omny.info/fares), so you never pay more than <span>$</span>34 over that period.
    <ul>
      <li>Metro Card is the pre-paid version of this. If you need one, buy it directly from the machines to avoid being scammed. For example, a 7-Day Unlimited MetroCard costs <span>$</span>34 upfront, and can be used any number of times during those 7 days.
        <ul>
          <li>Be aware that if you swipe in, then get out from the station, and then attempt to shortly swipe in again, it will reject your swipe, due to being too recent. If that happens, ask a MTA attendant to let you in (if available), or do like many others and wait for someone to crack open the emergency exit from the inside. If you hear an alarm going off in the station, most likely it is because someone opened the emergency exit to let others in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Just like routine events such as figuring out post-tax prices purchases or how much and when to tip require some kind of mental effort, figuring out the different edge cases of the subway system will keep your mind busy. It is like there is a perpetual rat race game being played in the city.
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes trains stop at all stations, sometimes they don’t, sometimes trains have indicators of which station you are in, sometimes they don’t, sometimes the station has (non-standard) indications of how much time it takes for the next train to arrive, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes it rains heavily inside the stations, sometimes it doesn’t.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="other-notes">Other Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Something unexpected to me, which cannot be transmitted through visual media, is the collection of smells around New York, in almost all parts of the city, except a set of parks and neighborhoods mostly outside Manhattan. The smell of garbage (since it is comment that it accumulates in heaps of bags on city sidewalks), burnt street meat, horse manure in some parts of Central Park, a smell I can only describe as pervasive detergent / laundry smell that could even be detected inside several buildings like the MET and Delis; the strong smell of road paint (since it appears that several of the streets were recently repainted), and signature smells from the subway</li>
  <li>Several subway lines are relatively shallow, so they are easily heard at street level. They also generally run below the roads themselves, which I would assume to make it easier when building incredibly high skyscrapers whose foundations run quite deep.</li>
  <li>Be attentive of your surroundings and where you walk, such dodging through garbage debris and sidewalk cellar doors, be them open or <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2015/01/26/man-dies-falling-through-cellar-doors-in-brooklyn/">closed</a></li>
  <li>Be prepared to encounter people who are not as well off, and might be living in the streets. Use your judgment, keep out of confusions, be respectable and don’t engage with people who have serious mental issues. If you are in a rougher area, memorize your path when possible, and stop at a local shop if you need to get your bearings. Use your common sense</li>
  <li>You might have noticed that I didn’t mention the common Edge / Top of the Rock / Summit One / Empire State Building / etc observation decks. It’s not that I don’t enjoy incredible views, but it didn’t fall high enough on the list of priorities, specially because I’ve had the opportunity to see skyline views through other buildings I’ve passed by, such as the Hotel.</li>
  <li>I tend to like long trans-atlantic flights, since they provide a moment of low stimuli, where there is less incentive to use the internet. My personal piece of advice would be to avoid the usual in-flight entertainment. I love to use them to resume a book or to write down my reflections from a trip for example (several of article lines were written during the return flight)</li>
  <li>This only shows my ignorance, but I had no idea that so many well-known artists were originally from New York, like Jay-Z (Brooklyn), Cardi B (South Bronx), Spike Lee (Brooklyn), and of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RciKM866Rhk">Jenny from the block</a>. That explains why I’ve consecutively heard “Empire State of Mind”, from Jay-Z and Alicia Keys (Hell’s Kitchen), and “All I want for Christmas is You”, from Mariah Carey (raised in Huntington).</li>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Ever since I was a kid I had a considerable fascination with the USA. The culture that arrived through the small and big screens, the big companies and entrepreneurs that I admired, the language, the people I’ve met along the way, the stories. Having had the opportunity to visit and experience it first hand was a true privilege. I’ve lived it like it was my last time, and it imprinted in me several thoughts and perspectives that I’m sure to last a lifetime.</p>

<p>New York ain’t no DisneyLand, and Elmo’s pictures in Times Square don’t come for free either, so set expectations accordingly. It can be one of the most fulfilling experiences you’ll ever have. I advise you to come prepared and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Frank Sinatra sang that he wants “to wake up in the city that doesn’t sleep”. That phrase has a deep meaning that only struck me during my trip. The city does not indeed sleep. The Times Square lights, 24 hour subway, the constant movement. Living in NYC wakes you up, not only literally, but also figuratively. It wakes you up to a different reality that keeps you on your toes in several ways. In a way, it’s a celebration of life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Words are cheap and keep getting cheaper. The last notes on this blog could have been written via generative AI, and as time goes by, new generative models will likely create higher quality content than I could ever produce, consistently.</p>

<p>I didn’t use these because the <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking.html">writing process comes as a form of thinking</a>, but if there are automated mechanisms that increasingly outperform us humans in so many different areas, what does that leave us?</p>

<h2 id="human-connection">Human connection</h2>

<p>How comfortable would you be in having a relationship with a being that is orders of magnitude more intelligent and capable than you? Not just logical-mathematical intelligence, but emotional, linguistic, musical or even spatial intelligence.</p>

<p>A being so advanced that any form of communication or relationship between you and it would always be severely constrained, even with neural interfaces. A being so advanced that you would never be able to have an essential understanding of it. A being so advanced that you wouldn’t even know that you are being manipulated by it. How many humans do you know who are friends with chimpanzees or bonobos, our closest relatives?</p>

<p>We are still human beings, with all the perks and limitations that come with it.</p>

<p>I would claim that humans will always be attracted to their familiar counterparts. Other beings that share their own struggles and limitations, and by consequence, what they create and share. Machines have their important place in the world, and history has proven to us that life as whole improved as technology evolved to serve us, but it would be healthier for us to think of them as tools, rather than human replacements.</p>

<h2 id="bioengineered">Bioengineered</h2>

<p>We have been fitted with extraordinary senses and tools that allow us to efficiently interact with the world. It took milenea for nature to shape us, and as Leonardo da Vinci puts it when comparing natural to artificial structures: “Nature made the most perfect inventions. There is nothing superfluous, there is nothing lacking” (paraphrased)</p>

<h3 id="our-place">Our place</h3>

<p>Try having a machine fixing the leaky pipe in your bathroom, or to change your desk’s lightbulb. Odds are that you’ll be flooded and in the dark in the nearterm. There will come a point where they will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpraXaw7dyc">likely do that</a>, but we are still not there.</p>

<p>Machines / tools currently outperform us in several tasks on the digital realm, and in several heavy duty physical tasks. But when it comes to fine digital dexterity, human connection, and interaction with the real world and its complexities, we still have an edge.</p>

<h2 id="future-proofing">Future Proofing</h2>

<p>Take a look at the daily tasks in your job. How repetitive are they? If they are repetíve, how much of a human element is present? Look at your organization and see where rubber meets the road in terms of human connection and physical intervention.</p>

<p>Strive to be closer to that human interface and focus on delivering tangible value to people or businesses (group of people). With this simple mindset, I believe you’ll be in a safer place, surrounded with an abundant supply of meaningful (monetary, emotional, etc) value that you can extract and provide.</p>

    <updated>2023-10-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/10/21/investment_relative_cost_benefit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s say you spend <span>$</span>1,000 to acquire film equipment (camera, microphones, and lights) to shoot YouTube videos. If you use this equipment to film and publish 2 videos, it means that each of those videos costs <span>$</span>500 to produce. If 100 videos are published, each of them cost <span>$</span>10. If all of these videos are able to generate <span>$</span>10 of revenue, then the entire cost of the initial investment was amortized.</p>

<p>The above is a severely gross simplification<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the key point is that an investment left unused has a high associated cost. In the case above, if only two videos were to be produced, then it would have been a better idea to rent the equipment instead.</p>

<p>This simple heuristic of mapping the investment cost to its usage and upside, can be a potential rule of thumb in different scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="other-examples">Other Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apartment Rent</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You are renting an apartment for <span>$</span>1,000 per month. During the week you work in an office, on weekends you are sometimes out, and during the year you take sporadic vacations outside. Let’s say that, on average, you spend 14 hours per day on your apartment, including sleep → 14 hours * 30 days = 420 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that it costs costs about <span>$</span>33 per day to live in the apartment, or <span>$</span>2.3 per hour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Study → Work → Net Worth Gain</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You studied 30 hours per week for 3 years (30 hours per week * 52 weeks * 3 years = 4680 hours) to land a job that increases your net worth <span>$</span>10.000 every year (on average), for 30 years. A total of <span>$</span>300,000 of networth gains.</li>
      <li>This means that you will gain about <span>$</span>64 for each hour invested in studying, or $274 per day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Clothing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy pair of trousers for <span>$</span>50, and wear them twice per month throughout for 2 years (24 months * 2 times per month = 48 times these were used).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs about <span>$</span>1 to wear them each time.
        <ul>
          <li>By contrast, if these trousers were only used <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860620/fast-fashion-zara-hm-forever-21-boohoo-environment-cost">7 times</a>, it would cost about <span>$</span>7.14 to wear them each time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a Playstation 5 for <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console"><span>$</span>499.99</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/01/ps4_has_a_very_high_software_attach_rate_average_player_owns_around_ten_games">10 games</a> (<span>$</span>60 each) totalling <span>$</span>1.100. You play <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/ld7zuo/what_was_your_total_amount_of_hours_played_in_2020/">60 hours per year</a> during 5 years (60 hours * 5 years = 300 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that each playing hour costs about <span>$</span>3.6.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phone</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy an iPhone 15 Pro for <span>$</span>999, and use it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59952557">4.8 hours per day</a> during <a href="https://www.iphonelife.com/content/how-long-do-iphone-last-how-to-know-when-to-upgrade-your-iphone">2 years</a> (4.8 hours * 365 days * 2 years = 3504 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.29 per hour of active usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Computer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a MacBook Pro 13” for <span>$</span>$1299, and <a href="https://mediapeanut.com/how-long-should-a-macbook-pro-last/">use it</a> 3 times per week for 2.5 hours per session, throughout 7 years (3 times per week * 2.5 hours * 52 weeks per year * 7 years = 2730 hours)</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.48 per hour of usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Musical Instrument</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a guitar for <span>$</span>100. You play the guitar once per week, for one hour, during 2 years. 52 weeks * 1 hour * 2 years = 104 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour playing the guitar has a cost of <span>$</span>1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Video Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a standard Netflix subscription that costs <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926/us"><span>$</span>15.99 per month</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/advisor/vpn/netflix-statistics">3.2 hours</a> (3.2 hours * 30 days = 96 hours per month) of videos throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This mean that each hour costs about $0.17.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Audio Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a premium Spotify subscription that costs <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"><span>$</span>10.99 per month</a>, and listen to about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/813876/spotify-monthly-active-users-time-spent-listening/">25 hours</a> of music and podcasts throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour costs about <span>$</span>0.44.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We could go on with further examples, as this simple heuristic could be applied to several scenarios, and the cost cost benefit analysis could have any perspective one so desires, but I would invite you to visit your storage and search for something you acquired long ago that got used less times than expected, and do a rough calculation of what was it’s relative cost / benefit.
The same for any other investment you did in the past.</p>

<p>Was it a surprising result?</p>

<p>How did it stack up against your initial expectations?</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/09/30/goal_clarity_in_delegation.html"/>
    <updated>2023-09-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/09/30/goal_clarity_in_delegation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously, in <a href="https://lopespm.com/2022/03/22/learnings-software-engineer-techlead.html">“Learnings as a Software Engineer Techlead”</a>, I’ve alluded to the 75/25 rule, where if you are ~75% certain that someone will correctly execute a given project/task, then delegate. The other ~25% is the unknown space that the person needs in order to learn, explore, make errors, innovate and grow.</p>

<p>If the project/task was decided to be delegated, what comes next?</p>

<h2 id="clarity-of-goals">Clarity of Goals</h2>

<p>One common challenge I’ve confronted when delegating was how unpredictable and uncontrollable the results felt upon handing over the work. This unstructured approach often left me thinking how I could decrease the non-completion risk by diminishing the delegated scope, and created confusion on the delegatee side on how they could proceed.</p>

<p>One tidbit of information from the “Who not How” book provided the guidance and structure to unlock this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(…) research has found that teams who have high levels of autonomy but low clarity goals, as well as little performance feedback, perform worse than teams with low autonomy.</p>

  <p><em>― <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Not-How-Accelerating-Teamwork-ebook/dp/B0867ZJ151">Who not How, by Dan Sullivan with Dr. Benjamin Hardy</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is claimed in the above research that teams which have high autonomy, high goal clarity and regular feedback on their results, were observed to have their performance shooting through the roof.</p>

<p>Apart from regular feedback, goal clarity is incredibly important, and even though it might sound obvious, it can be overlooked and drowned out on the process of delegation.</p>

<h2 id="clarity-in-practice">Clarity, in Practice</h2>

<p>After the above realization, I’ve made it a priority for each piece of delegated work to clearly define what was expected as an outcome, its definition of done, important milestones and deadlines, when should an issue be scaled to me, and which are the ownerships for each of the participants.</p>

<p>All of the above communicated in a clear and concise way, and preferably publicly documented to increase accountability and decrease ambiguity (depending on the situation, merely communicating these verbally might be enough, especially if the task is simple).</p>

<h2 id="the-delegation-formula">The Delegation Formula</h2>

<p>Given the above, the proposed formula for delegation is:</p>

<p><em>Delegation = [ 75/25 rule -&gt; Goal Clarity + Autonomy + Regular Feedback ]</em></p>

    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/08/19/life_exits</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Life has several exits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The exit from your workplace. The last day of work for your employer or your company.</li>
  <li>The exit from that youth group that accompanied you through teenage years and early adulthood.</li>
  <li>The exit from your high-school.</li>
  <li>The exit from your hometown.</li>
  <li>The exit from a long term relationship.</li>
  <li>The exit from life. Your funeral.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon your exit, your contributions, actions, decisions, opinions and presence most likely will have affected the trajectories of the people and the world around you, in obvious and less obvious ways. Perhaps your own trajectory was deeply changed as well.</p>

<p>These exits may be celebrated, be a special day with fulfilling words and thoughts. They may be the last time you see a set of people. The last time you will see them in your entire life.</p>

<p>Perhaps upon your final exit, you have made such consequential dents on the world that your name will be engraved into the annals of history for centuries to come. On the other hand, contemporary personalities such Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Warren Buffet might be mostly forgotten a few centuries from now. People will move on, so most likely you should be grateful if your loved ones keep you in their thoughts for those ensuing decades.</p>

<p>Life has several exits. Life is also short and limited. There’ll be a finite number of exits you will experience. Make the most out of each period they enclose.</p>

    <updated>2023-08-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to want something. If you are fortunate enough to be on <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels/income-level-4/">income level 4</a> living in a peaceful nation, the world has so much to offer, within easy reach. Yet, the currencies required to enjoy them are limited: time, energy, health, money. Even though it is easy to make lists of everything one wants (typically occurring on yearly passages, such as new year’s and anniversaries), only a handful of them are achievable.</p>

<h2 id="smaller-lists-require-sacrifices">Smaller lists require sacrifices</h2>
<p>Given that lengthy lists are unachievable, they need to be slimmed down to a manageable and realistic size. They need to be prioritized. <em>Prioritization</em> is an euphemism for <em>sacrificing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to want something, it’s hard to choose it against another desirable one.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>At the start of each year, I produce a small list of 3 to 4 high priority goals and 1 optional low priority goal of what I want to achieve by end of it, along with a small description on why I want them, and their impact. This takes several hours, sometimes days to put together, because of all the other ones that need to be left out.</p>

<p>Once the list is made though, it’s incredibly powerful due to it’s easy recall. This means that whenever I am faced with conflicting preferences, I can easily remember it and know in a snap what is the right thing to do. That is the real power behind that list. It’s guiding all the tiny small steps and decisions happening throughout the year, bringing me progressivily closer to those goals.</p>

<h2 id="the-question">The question</h2>
<p>The real question behind defining <em>knowing what we want</em> is actually <em>what we are willing to sacrifice</em>. Once the latter is defined and we are 100% convinced about it, then <em>knowing what we want</em> is bullet proof and easy to follow through. </p>

<p>What are you willing to sacrifice?</p>

    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT triggered a remarkable societal and computational shift that feels comparable to the impact from the initial internet era with its first impressive search engines like Google. LLMs are the toast of the town.</p>

<p>Writing emails, reports, school homework, analysis, code, summaries. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Save from when you would delegate this task to another fellow human, long hours would be passed in the past trying to conjure a piece of text that could communicate something to another entity. Now this can be made at scale, at low cost, with low effort.</p>

<p>Since we are still liable for the results of this tool, i.e. it’s still our name on the email sender, instead of just sending that email, we might first read that LLM output, interpret it, understand it, and then send it.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-text">More than just text</h2>

<p>Text is a form of communication. If something, or someone wrote it for us, certain decisions were made along the way to convey the goal that we gave. Out of the many paths possible to crystallize that piece of knowledge into a piece text, one of them was chosen.</p>

<p>I would claim that something gets lost on that delegation.</p>

<p>The writing process is more than just the production of text. Many times it requires the exploration of different perspectives, thinking deeply and coming to terms that we don’t know enough about a subject and need to learn more about it.</p>

<p>For example, it’s essential for me to have a notebook at hand to take notes during meetings and formal discussions. I write phrases, loose words, make small diagrams, jot down some reminders. Some of them are never to be re-read again, others I revisit to structure them down into a concise structure. Most of all, they help me think about a problem.</p>

<p>Same holds for notes and articles. I start with a cloud of loosely related ideas, which I attempt to refine into a structured form. Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)">double diamond</a> process.</p>

<p>Same for books. Several times I’ve come to terms that I learned close to nothing about a book read one month before. Or conversations. Or movies. Or experiences.</p>

<p>This is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otazg3TuPWM">except</a> if I reflected or acted about them. Except if I wrote down my conclusions about them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, taking notes helps make sure that I’m really thinking hard about what’s in there. If I disagree with the book, sometimes it takes a long time to read the books because I’m writing so much in the margin</p>

    <updated>2023-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/custom-pomodoro-technique</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.</p>

  <p><em>― Theophrastus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are countless articles, books, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4">videos</a> and lectures about time management. Since all of us have different needs, goals and environments, it is best to face them as guidances, where we take the ones we need, and leave the others in our toolbelt for another time.</p>

<p>One of these methodologies is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>, in which a kitchen timer is used to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. </p>

<p>This doesn’t work for me, so here is my <em>Custom Pomodoro Technique</em>.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>I usually need long bouts of deep focus during my work or any complex tasks. This can be reading / writing code, aligning with partners, structuring plans, going through my finances, etc. 25 minutes is typically not enough, since it coincides with where most of my flow peaks happen.</p>

<p>One hour is my target for continuous focused work. Below that, I know that I can still take advantage of the remaining time to productively go through a problem. Above that, I start to prepare to wind down and take a break.</p>

<p>Rule of thumb for breaks are to be enough to feel rested, which tends to happen in less than 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>I’ve tried several tools to track time. Physical and digital. Complex and simple. One has stuck for several years, and is the only one I use right now: <a href="https://www.klokki.com/">Klokki</a></p>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_full_dialog.webp" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog" />
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_full_dialog.png" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog" />
             <img src="https://lopespm.com/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_full_dialog.png" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog" />
           </picture>
         </center>

<p>Klokki is a concise Mac application that tracks time and generates nice time reports. It also allows you to track your time automatically, but I don’t use that feature.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful tool that fulfills my main requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being able to start and stop the timer with a single click.</li>
  <li>The timer should be always visible, but also non-obtrusive.</li>
  <li>Simple usage, with a low UI footprint. No distractions.</li>
  <li>Concise time reports, which allow me to know how much time (and energy) I’ve used throughout the week. This is important for pacing calibration.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The rules</h2>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki on the toolbar, when started">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_on_1_minute.webp" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki on the toolbar, when started" />

           </picture>
         </center>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever I sit down at the computer and start working, I start the timer. <em>I converged into using a single category to track all my deep flow blocks, since having multiple categories created too much mental overhead</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever the timer is on, I’m in productivity / work mode, and no distractions outside my goals are allowed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refrain from stopping the flow session before the one hour mark. Start preparing to stop the flow session after the 1 hour mark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take breaks in-between flow sessions, until I feel rested. Normally less than 15 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the timer is off, scattered tasks, exploration and wandering are allowed and encouraged.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-benefits">The benefits</h2>

<p>This is an incredibly simple methodology that I’ve been using throughout the past years. The recurrent benefits I’ve captured from it were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear boundaries between focus time and exploration.</li>
  <li>Simple, easy to follow process, allowing for flexibility on how time blocks are managed. Easy to consistently abide by.</li>
  <li>Pacing: prevents over-working or under-utilization of my energy / time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to use this guidance / methodology and experiment with it, Or not 🙏</p>

    <updated>2023-05-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/05/18/solving-task-switching-through-documentation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We don’t actually multitask. We switch-task, rapidly shifting from one thing to another, interrupting ourselves unproductively, and losing time in the process <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It just so happens that many aspects of our life require managing multiple tasks at the same time, so how to approach it?</p>

<p>One strategy that consistently worked for me has been using documentation to checkpoint each step of a process. Just like in a videogame where the last saved checkpoint can be recalled.</p>

<h2 id="the-backtracking-inefficiency">The Backtracking Inefficiency</h2>

<p>Similar to a CPU, our short-term memory (STM) has access to a limited amount (around four or seven concepts have been suggested <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) of very quick memory. Everytime we change to a different task, most of the resident concepts need to be flushed in order to load the ones from the incoming task. This is quite taxing by itself and narrowly optimizable, since our wetware is mostly fixed. The biggest efficiency opportunities lie in <em>where</em> these concepts are loaded from.</p>

<p>When working on a task, often we grab several simultaneous concepts, combine them together and generate new ones, which are then added to the concept pool and built upon further. During this process we are faced with these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Option 1.</strong> Don’t store our working memory - essentially lose work. Let’s rule out this option.</li>
  <li><strong>Option 2.</strong> Progressively store the existing concepts into our long term memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Option 3.</strong> Progressively store the existing concepts into an external memory bank, such as a document or piece of paper.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 2.</strong> works well, but requires significant cognitive effort and often only keeps the most relevant conclusions. If for some reason these need to be re-considered or understood why they were generated in the first place, we backtrack into the seminal thought processes, which in turn will probably require a repetition of previous work.</p>

<p>This is one of the biggest offenders when task switching, because even if we recall the end state of a task (which is hard by itself), a lot of time and energy are spent when revisiting the overall context via backtracking.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-as-checkpoint-mechanism">Documentation as Checkpoint Mechanism</h2>

<p>Enter <strong>Option 3.</strong>: <em>Progressively store these existing concepts into an external memory bank, such as a document or piece of paper.</em> Although writing in an external memory bank the contents of our working memory can take some effort, the yielded results greatly justify the initial investment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less cognitive load upon re-starting a task</li>
  <li>Backtracking effort is reduced, since it is a matter of reading a document</li>
  <li>Shareable with other stakeholders, which shaves off the time required to explain these concepts</li>
  <li>Task switching becomes smoother and less burdensome</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The documentation’s structure significantly impacts how efficiently it can be parsed and shared. That is a whole new topic by itself.</li>
  <li>Documentation as a checkpointing mechanism is a great way to consolidate personal learnings and reflections. It’s a valuable tool for leveraging life’s experiences to mature and grow. <em><strong>Option 1.</strong> is such a waste.</em></li>

    <updated>2023-05-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/05/04/the-case-for-not-having-tv</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavidSinclairPodcast">David Sinclair</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab">Andrew Hubberman</a> on how to extend lifespan or improve health markers, and a common trait emerges: the body strives and improves when exposed to just enough stress and struggle. Not too much, though. Cold baths, saunas, fasting, exercise, red light (which disrupts the way that our mitochondria make energy), eating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO8FJ8i02Xo">stressed greens</a>, are examples of just that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you spend your whole day sitting, or typing, always satisfying your hunger, your AMPK and mTOR pathways (which are master regulators of cell metabolism) and sirtuins say: <em>“Hey, times are good. Let’s just grow tissue, go forth, multiply and not build a sustainable body in the long run.”</em></p>

<p>The idolized unhurdled, stable and comfortable life, the easy access to resources and high caloric food, can do more harm than good when left unattended.</p>

<h2 id="the-riveting-third-person">The riveting third person</h2>

<p>I’ve consumed gargantuous amounts of television throughout my youth, so I’ve grown familiar with it’s charming alure. In an almost frictionless experience, where it suffices to lean back and pick one of the channels or series/movies/documentaries readily suggested by a streaming provider, an experience is entered where carefully crafted packages and passionate stories are delivered to us, requiring only our attention. It can even serve as the <em>third-person</em> to liven up the room, when in a tedious moment with a loved one.</p>

<p>No real struggle, no real effort required. A passive experience. The body rejoices in it, like it does when ingesting a sugar packed sweet. Just like most, I enjoy that feeling. Just like most, I have a limited amount of willpower. Hence why I don’t have a TV at home. Neither do I have sweets.</p>

<p>I love it. I don’t love the fact that I’m blocking myself away from those satisfactions. No, I relish the long term results. The time it opens up to actively read, write (this post for example), create, think, be present with others, and even watch podcasts (of which I make an effort to pick an episode outside the normal recommendations). I’m not perfect, and the above serves as a rule for me. And rules do have exceptions, and that’s ok. </p>

<p>Still, this is the case for not having a TV.</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/04/07/first-note.html"/>
    <updated>2023-04-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/04/07/first-note</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <em>Notes</em>!</p>

<p>This is a new space where you will be able to find essays, notes and other quick thoughts, whereas the existing <em>Blog</em> section will remain allocated to denser article pieces.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<h3 id="the-recurrent-idea">The Recurrent Idea</h3>

<p>I have a rule when buying non-essential items for my house: if I’ve been recurrently thinking about buying something over a span of multiple days, then it’s a good purchasing signal. The thought process for writing articles for this blog is similar.</p>

<p>The downside of this approach is that the ideas and thoughts that don’t make it to a blog article are relegated into the realm of personal writings and/or conversations with others, but never exposed to the public. On the other hand, this very same thirst to share quick thoughts was recurrent by itself.</p>

<h3 id="framing">Framing</h3>

<p>The yearning towards developing this concept was there, but a satisfactory hosting plaform was missing still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitter: although it allowed for volume and looser thoughts, the character restriction would limit the exploration of a topic, and all the content would not be owned by me.</li>
  <li>New self-hosted space: this allowed me to own the contents and have a clear separation between dense blog articles and quick thoughts, but the maintenance cost was prohibitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third option was to host them here, in <em>Byte Tank</em>, which was customized over several years and already had the workflow and components I strived for. But how to frame this new concept into the existing structure?</p>

<p>The answer came from <a href="https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/How%20I%20write%20this%20blog%20on%20my%20iPhone%20in%20a%20train">Alin Panaitiu</a>. On his website, Alin has a separate section for <em>Notes</em>, which makes perfect sense to me. <em>Notes</em> sets the expectation that they are not fully fledged articles, and that they cater towards volume, rather than density.</p>

<h3 id="making-it-a-reality">Making it a reality</h3>

<p>An idea is only worth for its implementation, and these were the last nudges that incentivized me to bring it to life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inspiring examples presented in several of the comments in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35164819">Ask HN: What has your personal website/blog done for you?</a>. One of them being a reference to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/">Why and how to write things on the Internet</a>, the other one being Alin’s website (see above).</li>
  <li>The spirit of the earlier Internet. I remember the earlier times of the Internet where there was this widespread fascination with the fact that with a telephone connection, one could have access to its immense world, and had the possibility to create their own virtual home, that anyone could visit. That is one of the many beauties of this massive network. Low cost, virtually no gatekeepers, nearly boundless. I find this idea incredibly exciting and empowering.</li>
  <li>Even in an era where text content is now produced for a low cost and in massive amounts (GPT and other LLMs), I believe there is still space for <em>artisanal</em> human baked opinions. The human relatableness, its connection with the environment, biology and even its limitations are still charming on their own.</li>
  <li>The incentive to create notes in volume could be a great way to generate more source material that can be coalesced into new blog articles</li>
  <li>Exposing looser thoughts publicly forces me to structure then, and I believe this process can make me better equipped to navigate the complex universe of human interactions, in which having a more structured mindset can make a world of a difference. Personally and professionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>

<p>This is an exciting new phase for this modest establishment, and I’m looking forward to populating this section with new content. Until then!</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> </li>
  <li>By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready—for nothing in particular. (…) what could be a more appropriate reward for two decades of résumé-building than a seemingly elite, process-oriented career that promises to “keep options open”? <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>The biggest battle I have is restricting their video game time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to read more than they play video games. They also can’t play completely stupid video games. There’s one game they downloaded recently called Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It’s like a Psych 101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play Flappy Golf instead, which is like Flappy <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth’s furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
  <li>Promises are easy and cheap to make, actual work is hard and expensive. If it wasn’t, you’d just have done it now rather than promised it later. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="business--companies">Business / Companies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Startups Are Easy, Stayups Are Hard <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>On describes the earliest startup as like driving a race car. You’re close to the ground, and you feel every move you make. You have control, you can turn quickly, you feel like things are moving fast. Of course, you’re also at risk of crashing at any moment, but you only take yourself down if you do. As you grow, you graduate to a commercial flight. You’re farther from the ground, and more people’s lives depend on you, so you need to consider your movements more carefully, but you still feel in control and can turn the plane relatively quickly. Finally, you graduate to a spaceship, where you can’t make quick moves and the course is set long in advance, but you’re capable of going very far and taking tons of people along for the ride. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Most of the people at PayPal don’t understand this. The reason it worked was because the cost of transactions in PayPal was lower than any other system. And the reason the cost of transactions was lower is because we were able to do an increasing percentage of our transactions as ACH, or automated clearinghouse, electronic transactions, and most importantly, internal transactions. Internal transactions were essentially fraud-free and cost us nothing. An ACH transaction costs, I don’t know, like twenty cents or something. But it was slow, so that was the bad thing. It’s dependent on the bank’s batch processing time. And then the credit card transaction was fast, but expensive in terms of the credit card processing fees and very prone to fraud. That’s the problem Square is having now. “Square is doing the wrong version of PayPal. The critical thing is to achieve internal transactions. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Is this thing any good? Does it solve a real problem? Should we have made it better? Are we making what customers want? Is anybody going to buy this? Did we price it right? <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>There’s only a bunch of business-axiom baloney like “If you’re not growing, you’re dying.” Says who? <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Are production incidents happening that are taking up lots of time? Are a bunch of people sick? Are they bickering over coding style in their code review comments? Are the tickets that are being written vague, too big, too small? Does the team seem upbeat in their communication style, sharing fun things as well as important work in chat, or are they purely business? Look at their calendars. Is the team spending many hours a week in meetings? Is their manager not doing 1-1s? None of these things are necessarily smoking guns, but they may point to an area to address. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Conway’s Law is often cited in discussions of this kind of structure. It states: “Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>As ridiculous and dangerous as this might seem, plenty of teams fall prey to the lure of status. These often include altruistic nonprofit organizations that come to believe that the nobility of their mission is enough to justify their satisfaction. Political groups, academic departments, and prestigious companies are also susceptible to this dysfunction, as they often see success in merely being associated with their special organizations. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Forget “minimum viable products”—ever since he started Apple in 1976, Jobs saw that you can change the world through careful planning, not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others’ successes. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Because let’s face it: Goals are fake. Nearly all of them are artificial targets set for the sake of setting targets. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>Start with a shared understanding of the goals, risks, and the questions to answer before making a decision. When you assign the ownership for making a <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></li>
  <li>You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>It’s likely that Q1 (immediately after the winter holidays) will be the most productive and Q4 (the quarter that includes winter and the end-of-year holidays) will be the least productive. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Therefore, you must always be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don’t ask, especially if you believe that the project is critical or likely to take longer than a few weeks. This means you must be aggressive about getting estimates, and as we all know, software estimation is a very difficult process. Negotiating the process that your team uses to estimate, on what timescale, for what projects, may be part of your job at this level. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>If you haven’t taken the time to articulate the value of this work, it will get pushed aside in favor of projects that are more clearly valuable. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>My advice is to do your best to gather data to support yourself, and talk about what will be possible when the work is done. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>When an engineer comes to you with an engineering project that she wants to do, think about framing the project by answering these questions: How big is that project? How important is it? Can you articulate the value of that project to anyone who asks? What would successful completion of the project mean for the team? <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>The hardest part, in many ways, was getting started. The second-hardest part was getting comfortable making a guess about the future with highly imperfect information. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“The key, of course, is to define our goals, our results, in a way that is simple enough to grasp easily, and specific enough to be actionable. Profit is not actionable enough. It needs to be more closely related to what we do on a daily basis. (…) By combining some and eliminating others, they narrowed them to seven: revenue, expenses, new customer acquisition, current customer satisfaction, employee retention, market awareness, and product quality. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The most important lesson I’ve learned is that you have to be able to manage yourself if you want to be good at managing others. The more time you spend understanding yourself, the way you react, the things that inspire you, and the things that drive you crazy, the better off you will be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Contrary to the notion that teams waste time and energy arguing, those that avoid conflict actually doom themselves to revisiting issues again and again without resolution. They often ask team members to take their issues “off-line,” which seems to be a euphemism for avoiding dealing with an important topic, only to have it raised again at the next meeting. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>Great teams ensure that everyone’s ideas are genuinely considered, which then creates a willingness to rally around whatever decision is ultimately made by the group. And when that is not possible due to an impasse, the leader of the team is allowed to make the call. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) dysfunctional teams that try to hedge their bets and delay important decisions until they have enough data to feel certain that they are making the right decision. As prudent as this might seem, it is dangerous because of the paralysis and lack of confidence it breeds within a team. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>More than any other member of the team, the leader must be comfortable with the prospect of making a decision that ultimately turns out to be wrong. And the leader must be constantly pushing the group for closure around issues, as well as adherence to schedules that the team has set. What the leader cannot do is place too high a premium on certainty or consensus. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) the most effective and efficient means of maintaining high standards of performance on a team is peer pressure. One of the benefits is the reduction of the need for excessive bureaucracy around performance management and corrective action. More than any policy or system, there is nothing like the fear of letting down respected teammates that motivates people to improve their performance. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>If the boss really wants to know what’s going on, the answer is embarrassingly obvious: They have to ask! Not vague, self-congratulatory bullshit questions like “What can we do even better?” but the hard ones like “What’s something nobody dares to talk about?” or “Are you afraid of anything at work?” or “Is there anything you worked on recently that you wish you could do over?” Or even more specific ones like “What do you think we could have done differently to help Jane succeed?” or “What advice would you give before we start on the big website redesign project?” <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>A lack of engagement in meetings tends to mean the team isn’t engaged by the work or do not feel like they have a say in the decision-making process. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>But there is such a thing as artificial harmony, and conflict-avoidant managers tend to favor harmony above functional working relationships. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>The goal is to identify problems that are causing the team to work less effectively together and resolve them, not to become the team’s therapist. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Many of us believe that the way to be liked is to be seen as nice — that niceness is itself the goal. Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. It’s unkind to lead that person on, saying “Maybe you could get promoted,” and then watch her fail. It’s kind to tell someone that his behavior in meetings is disrupting the group. It’s awkward, and uncomfortable, but it’s also part of your job as his manager to have these difficult conversations. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Thinking about your actions is the best way to combat fear of conflict. Am I pushing this decision to the team because they really are the best people to decide, or am I just afraid that if I make an unpopular but necessary decision people will be mad at me? Am I avoiding working through this issue with my peer because she’s truly difficult to work with, or am I just hoping that the issue will resolve itself because I don’t want to have to discuss it and possibly be wrong? Am I holding back on giving my employee this feedback because he really was having a bad day and it’s just a one-off, or am I holding back because I’m afraid he won’t like me as a manager if I tell him? Be thoughtful about your behavior, and it’s unlikely that you’ll seek out unnecessary conflict. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>The real goal here is psychological safety — that is, a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Your first goal is to protect your team as a whole, the second is to protect each individual on the team, and your last priority is protecting yourself. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Simply put, if your team member doesn’t respect you or her peers, why is she working there? <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>So at the end of another day when I feel like I didn’t write enough code and I have no way to quantify what I’ve achieved, I tell myself I was being as good a manager as I know how to be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Project management. Onboarding new team members. Working with the product team to break down product roadmap goals into technical deliverables. Production support. These are all skills members of your team need to learn. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Even when you have been hired to fix a team, remember that the company has gotten this far because of some fundamental strengths. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Whether it’s QA, design, product management, or technical operations, ask lots of questions, but in an open way. Make it clear to the person that your goal is to understand what she does so that you’re capable of appreciating it better. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Sit in their meetings. Are they boring to you? Is the team bored? Who is speaking most of the time? Are there regular meetings with the whole team where the vast majority of the time is spent listening to the manager or product lead talk? Boring meetings are a sign. They may be a sign of inefficient planning on the part of the organizers. There may be too many meetings happening for the information covered. They may indicate that the team members don’t feel they can actually help set the direction of the team, or choose the work that will happen. They often signal a lack of healthy conflict on a team. Good meetings have a heavy discussion element, where opinions and ideas are drawn out of the team. If the meetings are overscripted, so that no real conversation can take place, it stifles that creative discussion. If people are afraid to disagree or bring up issues for fear of dealing with conflict, or if managers always shut down conflict without letting disagreements air, this is a sign of an unhealthy team culture. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>A bunch of people who never talk to each other and are always working on independent projects are not really working as a team. There would be nothing wrong with that if the team were performing well, but given that they’re not, this may be contributing to your problem. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Projects change. Teams may even be disbanded or moved around in ways that you don’t understand or agree with. As a manager, the best thing you can do is help people feel capable of tying up loose ends, stabilizing the current in-flight projects, and easing into their new work in a controlled fashion. This is an area where you can and should push back. Make sure that your teams get adequate time to finish up current work. Furthermore, push for engineering involvement in the early planning for the new work so that people can get excited about the projects they are moving on to. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>It’s not about being the lead engineer, chasing the latest language or framework, or having the shiniest technology. It’s about building a team with the tools and attributes to build the best possible product for our customers. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>You can’t give up the responsibility of management without giving up the power that comes with it. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Reach through the part of you that is shy about praising people or embarrassed to share your feelings, and go into the part of you that cares about the people you work with. You can share these stories in a way that is not forced or fake. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) the larger the company, the smaller the team should be at the top. And with the addition of a new head of sales and a human resources director, her staff had grown to a barely manageable eight. It wasn’t that Kathryn couldn’t handle the weekly one-on-ones, but it was increasingly difficult to have fluid and substantive discussions during staff meetings with nine people sitting around the table. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) trust is the confidence among team members that their peers’ intentions are good, and that there is no reason to be protective or careful around the group. (…) Teams that lack trust waste inordinate amounts of time and energy managing their behaviors and interactions within the group. They tend to dread team meetings, and are reluctant to take risks in asking for or offering assistance to others. As a result, morale on distrusting teams is usually quite low, and unwanted turnover is high. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initially the technologists and the hippies did not interface well. Many in the counterculture saw computers as ominous and Orwellian, the province of the Pentagon and the power structure. In The Myth of the Machine, the historian Lewis Mumford warned that computers were sucking away our freedom and destroying “life-enhancing values.” An injunction on punch cards of the period—“Do not fold, spindle or mutilate”—became an ironic phrase of the antiwar Left. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Engineers frequently struggle with the transition to respecting and communicating well with diverse peers. I believe the struggle with respect is a side effect of the current tech culture, which tells us that engineers are the smartest people in the room. It can’t be said strongly enough: your peers who are not analytically driven are not stupid. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Engineers who graduated from MIT” is not a culture. “People who value technology innovation, hard work, intellect, scientific process, and data” might be. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>A lot of interviews try to determine cultural fit by what I would call “friendship” markers, such as “Would you like being stuck in an airport with this person?” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Furthermore, culture fit as determined by friendship tests is almost certain to be discriminatory in some way. Humans form friendships with people who have significant shared background experiences, and these experiences tend to closely correlate with things like schooling, race, class, and gender. The shortcuts you get by hiring friends are not usually the values you need to form a strong team. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="systems--processes">Systems / Processes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>As your teams and systems grow, it’s almost impossible for any one person to keep the systems in her head. Because we have a bunch of people coordinating work, we evolve processes around that work coordination in order to make risks obvious. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) you should not put a complicated process on any activity where you want people to move quickly and where you believe the risk for change in that activity is low or that the risks themselves are obvious to the whole team. If you want to do code review for all changes, make sure that the process for code review is not so onerous that the team slows down significantly on minor changes, because that will impact your whole group’s productivity. The second implication is that you need to be on the lookout for places where there is hidden risk, and draw those hidden risks out into the open. There’s a saying in politics that “a good political idea is one that works well in half-baked form,” and the same goes for engineering processes. The processes should have value even when they are not followed perfectly, and that value should largely lie in the act of socializing change or risk to the team as a whole. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Be specific about the kinds of changes that need architecture review. Usually these include new languages, new frameworks, new storage systems, and new developer tooling. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>

<h2 id="focus-on-what-is-important">Focus on what is important</h2>
<ul>
  <li>But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister’s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></li>
  <li>It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for “realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise \$1,000,000 than it is \$100,000. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s. If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>One does not accumulate but eliminate. It is not daily increase but daily decrease. The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Five years of reporting on attention have confirmed some home truths,” Gallagher reports. “[Among them is the notion that] ‘the idle mind is the devil’s workshop’ when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right.” <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></li>
  <li>You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></li>

  <li>(…) a decision is better than no decision. They also realize that it is better to make a decision boldly and be wrong—and then change direction with equal boldness—than it is to waffle. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>If you’re 25 and announce you want to start a new circus, the response is different: Be realistic; become a lawyer or an accountant or a doctor, have babies, and raise them to repeat the cycle. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one’s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></li>
  <li>Much of your pain is self-chosen. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
  <li>No is easier to do, yes is easier to say. No is no to one thing. Yes is no to a thousand things. (…) No is calm but hard. Yes is easy but a flurry. Knowing what you’ll say no to is better than knowing what you’ll say yes to. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) so practice getting comfortable with the quick no (and the quick yes!) for low-risk, low-impact decisions. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>When you want to allow for group decision making, the group needs to have a clear set of standards that they use to evaluate decisions. Start with a shared understanding of the goals, risks, and the questions to answer before making a decision. When you assign the ownership for making a decision to someone on the team, make it clear which members of the team should be consulted for feedback and who needs to be informed of the decision or plan. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Taking conflicting perspectives and incomplete information and setting a direction, knowing that the consequences of a poor decision will impact both you and possibly the whole team. If making decisions were easy, there would be much less need for managers and leaders. However, as anyone who has spent a lot of time managing can tell you, making decisions is one of the most draining and stressful parts of the job. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>

<h2 id="accountabilty">Accountabilty</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“I’m using you as an example, Carlos, because you are an easy person to let off the hook. But this could apply to anyone. Some people are hard to hold accountable because they are so helpful.

  <li>In fact, team members who are particularly close to one another sometimes hesitate to hold one another accountable precisely because they fear jeopardizing a valuable personal relationship.

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

  <li>In my experience, most people need to hear something at least three times before it really sinks in. You’re going to tell your own senior management and leadership team. You’ll hold an all hands meeting. You may need to send some email detailing the changes as well. A little bit of communication planning can go a long way in such situations. Try to anticipate the questions you might get and prepare answers for those questions. Be as clear as possible about the projects or structure to be changed, so there’s little room for confusion.

  <li>I define masculinity as that part of a man that equips him to survive as an individual, clan, and species. Without this masculine energy we would have all become extinct eons ago.

These aspects of masculinity include strength, discipline, courage, passion, persistence, and integrity. <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></li>
  <li>This frustration is due to the reality that in general, women view men who try to please them as weak and hold these men in contempt. Most women do not want a man who tries to please them — they want a man who knows how to please himself. Women consistently share with me that they don’t want a passive, pleasing wimp. They want a man — someone with his balls still intact <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></li>
  <li>When recovering Nice Guys create relationships with people who don’t need fixing, they improve their odds of finding the love they want.

  <li>Internalized shame and fear are the greatest barriers to a satisfying sex life. A man can read all the books he wants on “How To Pick Up Women” or watch all the instructional videos on improving sexual technique.

It struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously.

  <li>For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
  <li>Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power? Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind? Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy mountain? Tell me, have you these in your houses? Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master? <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
  <li>(about crime and punishment) And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
  <li>If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas. For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction. (…) And since you are a breath in God’s sphere, and a leaf in God’s forest, you too should rest in reason and move in passion. ​​<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
  <li>And the longer it lasted the more deadly it became. “It is as if I had been going downhill while I imagined I was going up. And that is really what it was. I was going up in public opinion, but to the same extent life was ebbing away from me. And now it is all done and there is only death. <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></li>
  <li>Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>There is only one means of salvation, then take yourself and make yourself responsible for all men’s sins, that is the truth, you know, friends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for everything and for all men, you will see at once that it is really so, and that you are to blame for every one and for all things. But throwing your own indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the pride of Satan and murmuring against God. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to self‐criticism. Don’t be like everyone else, even if you are the only one.” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>Don’t be afraid. Conflict avoidance often arises from fear. We’re scared of the responsibility of making the decision. We’re afraid of seeming too demanding. We’re afraid people will quit if we give them uncomfortable feedback. We’re afraid people won’t like us, or that we’ll fail when we take this risk. Some fear is natural, and being sensitive to the outcomes of conflict is a wise habit. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Conflict avoidance runs deep in most of us, and matters of what feels like personal style can be particularly difficult. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“I don’t think anyone ever gets completely used to conflict. If it’s not a little uncomfortable, then it’s not real. The key is to keep doing it anyway.” <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>This background, combined with a strong desire to be seen as smart and “right,” sometimes led to some less-than-productive conversations about technology directions. I’d find myself arguing the merits of a language choice or technology purely based on the technical merits. When this happened I became another engineer arguing in a group of engineers. It took me a long time to realize that my job wasn’t to be the smartest person in the room. It wasn’t to be “right.” Rather, my role was to help the team make the best possible decisions and help them implement them in a sustainable and efficient way. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Wanting to be a CTO (or VP of Engineering) is like wanting to be married. Remember that it’s not just the title, it’s also the company and the people that matter.” Titles are definitely not everything. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>Throwing out jargon to people who aren’t familiar with it — and who don’t even need to be familiar with it — makes us look stupid to them. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Okay, first of all, don’t ever slam one of your teammates when that person isn’t in the room. I don’t care what you think of Mikey. She is part of this team, and you have to take your issues to her directly, or to me. You’re going to have to make that right.” <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>

<h2 id="group-thinking--living-in-society">Group Thinking / Living in Society</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces. The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></li>
  <li>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>It takes a tribe to raise a human. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) for the craving for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men. Mankind as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>“What do you mean by isolation?” I asked him. “Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age—it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self‐destruction, for instead of self‐realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, ‘How strong I am now and how secure,’ and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self‐destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>

  <li>“Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances. Strong men believe in cause and effect.” <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>“He who is abandoned is an abandoner,” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>The invitation read, “There’s an old Hindu saying that goes, ‘In the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you.’ Come help me celebrate mine.” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) and more importantly, in order to take full advantage of the how, you need to understand the why. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></li>
  <li>What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>There is a direct correlation between an increased sphere of comfort and getting what you want. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>I define personal power as a state of mind in which a person is confident he can handle whatever may come. This kind of power not only successfully deals with problems, challenges and adversity, it actually welcomes them, meets them head on, and is thankful for them. Personal power isn’t the absence of fear. Even the most powerful people have fear. Personal power is the result of feeling fear, but not giving in to the fear. <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Comparison is the death of joy.” <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>Yet the timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness, And knows that yesterday is but today’s memory and tomorrow is today’s dream. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
  <li>Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) fools are made for wise men’s profit.” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>“There’s no such thing as a well-adjusted public figure. If they were well adjusted they wouldn’t try to be a public figure.” <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Men love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it’s a relative thing. Or isn’t it? Is it not relative? A treacherous question! <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) “happiness and positivity is a choice,” the teammate who pooh-poohs every idea and criticizes everything is going to have problems fitting in. Sometimes, people will change to adopt the values. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
  <li>“Politics is when people choose their words and actions based on how they want others to react rather than based on what they really think.” <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>Ideological conflict is limited to concepts and ideas, and avoids personality-focused, mean-spirited attacks. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
  <li>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts; And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime. And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wealth">Wealth</h2>
<ul>
  <li>And what follows from this right of multiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is getting more and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community, as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>(…) yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he would get that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him of itself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is with people who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, except to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own, and have no notion how money is obtained. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="history--evolution">History / Evolution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>It is unsettling – and perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could at one time have sex with an animal from a different species, and produce children together. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="religion--spirituality">Religion / Spirituality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“I think different religions are different doors to the same house. Sometimes I think the house exists, and sometimes I don’t. It’s the great mystery.” <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>For even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
  <li>Freedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: “Yes, you were right, you alone possess His mystery, and we come back to you, save us from ourselves!” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="geopolitics">Geopolitics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“Every morning at six A.M., the first thing to hit my desk was this overnight report that included information on who got killed and what killed them,” O’Connell said. “I kept thinking, This is insane. Why are we in this place? It was not just Iraq but the whole picture. Why were we so invested in that part of the world?” The unsurprising answer that O’Connell came up with was oil. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In Cowen’s future, huge gains in artificial intelligence will lead to the elimination of many of today’s high-employment lines of work. The people who thrive in this environment will be very bright and able to complement the machines and team effectively with them. As for the unemployed masses? Well, many of them will eventually find jobs going to work for the Haves, who will employ teams of nannies, housekeepers, and gardeners. If anything Musk is doing might alter the course of mankind toward a rosier future, Cowen can’t find it. Coming up with true breakthrough ideas is much harder today than in the past, according to Cowen, because we’ve already mined the bulk of the big discoveries. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>If not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan for a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your working lifetime of 40–50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid work. How many do you have to go? It’s probably time to cut your losses. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="off-the-cuff">Off the Cuff</h2>
<ul>
  <li>(Musk nearly died on a trip to Africa, where he caught a type of severe malaria. It was discovered late on his return to the United States, and Musk spent 10 agonizing days in intensive care. It took him six months to recover and lost 20 kilos during the illness.) “I came very close to dying,” Musk said. “That’s my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.” <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>“The guy comes in, and Elon asks him why they’re meeting,” Spikes said. “He said, ‘To develop a relationship.’ Elon replied, ‘Okay. Nice to meet you,’ which basically meant, ‘Get the fuck out of my office.’ <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is growth. You grow or you die.</p>

  <p><em>― Phil Knight, Shoe Dog</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve had the good fortune of having the opportunity to develop my software engineering work as a tech lead (which is not a fixed role), focusing more of my effort on solving sets of problems, as opposed to individual projects/tasks. While navigating this path, I’ve gathered a set of teachings from my mentors/peers/managers and other personal learnings and observations that I attempted to compile in a condensed list. Hopefully these can be useful in your own journey, just like other people’s learnings were to mine:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Planning</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear planning and prioritization of your projects is essential</strong>, especially in the early phases of an initiative. Well defined projects, with solid goaling metrics and well defined ownerships for each project, go a long way towards setting them up for success. These reduce the risk of not meeting goals, and allow for everyone involved to know which areas they need to tackle and own. Another interesting side effect is the value proposition to prospecting new-comers to support your projects, since there is a clear definition of what they can own and how valuable their contribution will be to the team/organization.</li>
      <li><strong>But don’t plan too much</strong> - healthy balance is the secret: if your organization is fast moving and dynamic, excessive planning can have the deleterious effect that <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/11647520">little execution is actually done</a>, since most of the time is spent planning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Design Docs, Strategy and Vision</strong>: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design Docs</strong> are a valuable vehicle to crystalize how a complex system or process can be implemented, they incentivize the owner to structure their thoughts, are made stronger by receiving feedback from peers, and serve as an exceptional piece of documentation that will not only explain how a given system/process works, but also serve a rationale on why they were built that way. Here is an <a href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/">example template from Google</a></li>
      <li><strong>Strategy and Vision</strong> - <em>This reflection will be mostly based on this great <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/engineering-strategy">StaffEng article</a>, which I vividly recommend.</em> If you realize that you’ve rehashed the same discussion three or four times, look into your organization’s objectives, find the commonalities from five of your organization’s design docs, combine all of these together, and you have material to write a strategy. When the future’s too hazy to identify investments worth making, grab five strategies, combine them with your organization’s objectives and write a vision for two to three years out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Scaling oneself</strong>: The best way to increase impact is by scaling oneself. I’ve personally encountered my speed limit when trying to solve a critical-path project, while at the same attempting to set the direction for the team. As much as I worked, placed hours, or made the process effective, I was the bottleneck. I’ve hit a speed limit, and at the time it was made clear by my manager that in order to increase impact, unblock our team, achieve our objectives and have a balanced workload, I would need to scale myself.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scaling through Delegation - the 75/25 rule</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>If you are ~75% certain that someone will correctly execute a given project/task, then delegate. The other ~25% is the unknown space that the person needs in order to learn, explore, make errors and innovate. In other words, grow.</li>
          <li>If you are 100% certain that the delegatee will successfully achieve a given project/task, they will not grow. On the other hand, if the probability of success is too low, then the project/task will be frustrating, probably will not be completed, and will jeopardize the team’s objectives.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>By default, don’t micromanage</strong>: 
        <ul>
          <li>When delegating a task/project, give enough space for the delegatee to own it. In general, the objective is to clearly define expectations, clearly define areas of ownership, and agree upon which details you should be kept up to date, which meetings you should attend, and in which situations you would expect to be pinged for escalations.</li>
          <li>Micromanaging only makes sense in very specific situations, such as when there is a high possibility of a major failure and help is needed to firefight and course correct.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If you are not failing, you’re not pushing hard enough. And probably not growing</strong>: Conversely, the 75/25 rule can be applied to oneself. If you find you are easily executing your projects with a high level of predictability, this provides a hint that you should look for bigger challenges and responsibilities. In other words, aim for a growth mindset, rather than a fixed mindset.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Errors</strong>: Making errors is completely OK and expected. They are part of the ~25% above. Strive for them to happen only once, otherwise they will fail to serve their learning purpose.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mentorship</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Give: one of the best ways to learn how to support projects is to mentor a new joiner.</strong> This will give you the opportunity to develop your interpersonal and project managing skills as you support/scope/prioritize projects and tasks for your mentee, and will help you consolidate your knowledge about the team and its position in the company as you transmit this knowledge forward. This relationship is especially rewarding in the long term as you work together on other projects down the line.</li>
      <li><strong>Receive: having good mentors is one of the best ways to quickly grow and learn.</strong> I have had the good fortune to learn from specially good mentors throughout my tenure, who apart from sharing their deep technical knowledge about our systems and processes, provided me solid foundations (either directly or by example) on how to navigate ambiguity and tackle challenging projects/situations. Every new mentor will have something novel to share and teach to you, it is an ongoing process. Good mentors provide you a golden path that you can follow to cut through the exhausting search for viable solutions to a given problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Learn from others</strong>: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outside your organization</strong>: other people’s experiences are immensely helpful, specially the ones that have been time tested and are well structured. Books are a good source of this knowledge, and I would recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a>, from which I extracted many of my base understandings of what a techlead should be, do and behave. The book goes straight to the point, gives actionable examples and was written by a very experienced manager.</li>
      <li><strong>Reach out to your peers</strong>: specially in the beginning of my role as techlead, I was struggling to find the right balance between personal impact from my own actions and (the less concrete) directional impact. To resolve my conundrum, I’ve reached out for support from my manager, my original mentor and a fellow experienced techlead. Their experiences and advices helped me to tackle this subject, and other challenges that came along the way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Measure your success</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goaling against quantifiable metrics = solid prioritization and justification</strong>: Make sure that all your projects are goaled against an objective, quantifiable metric. Otherwise it will be hard to prioritize between them and justify their value during planning and execution to your peers and external stakeholders.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear and quantifiable goals = increased motivation</strong>: Projects with goals based on solid metrics allow for anyone working on a project to know how valuable their contribution will be. I would claim that working on projects with an ambiguous value proposition is frustrating and will receive less attention and effort from everyone involved, since it will not be clear how impactful their actions will be.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure your personal progress by asking for candid feedback</strong>: if your manager and/peers don’t give you candid feedback on your progress, ask for it explicitly. It is one of the best ways to measure your progress on your role and surfacing any blindspots.</li>
      <li><strong>No measurement = flying blind</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Communication - what you transmit, and how, matters</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Written and oral communication is essential when explaining the rationale behind an objective/project/task, and when coordinating with your peers and other stakeholders. This is a skill that can be learned, and one that I am still actively evolving. The best way to improve it, as I have found, is to write more, speak more, make more presentations, and study the communication methods from others.</li>
      <li>As a rule of thumb, most communication styles benefit from a “news article” structure: first a TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read), then an overall context of the problem in question and its impact, followed by details such as the delineation of a set of solutions, ending with a call to action or further questions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Imposter syndrome</strong>: this might stem from a mismatch between your perceived performance and expectations for your role. Work with your manager to explicitly define expectations. Ask your manager and peers for explicit feedback, so you can better calibrate your perceptions. If you feel like an imposter, odds are, <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/actual-impostors-dont-get-impostor-syndrome/">you aren’t</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Take care of your body and mind, they are your ultimate tools</strong>: Last but not least, exercise, eat healthy food, nourish your relationships and strive for quality sleep. These are the essential tenants for the infrastructure (you) that will sustain all of the above points.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>Hacker News is my go-to source for relevant, interesting and constructive discussions on a wide range of topics. I usually consume it via <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">Daemonology’s Hacker News Daily</a>, to catch up on the most active topics in the community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">Daemonology’s Hacker News Daily</a> presents the title, story link, Hacker News discussion link, and is optimized for desktop. I usually consult it on mobile, and when I am several days behind, I sweep through the archives and open several story/discussion links in separate mobile tabs, in order to triage the stories with a quick glance at their web page and their discussion’s top comments.</p>

<p>This project aims to ease that process, by generating a set of web pages presenting the best daily Hacker News for mobile or desktop, with screenshots and top comments for each story, while aiming to have a low footprint to the end user.</p>

<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="https://lopespm.com/files/hackernews_daily/hn_daily_diagram.png"><img src="https://lopespm.com/files/hackernews_daily/hn_daily_diagram.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Information flow diagram between the different components of the system </figcaption></figure>

<p>The basilar idea is to recurrently get the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">best Hacker News</a> stories via its <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a>; take screenshots of the web pages that these stories link to; and have this workflow executed via <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>

<p>In specific, these are the steps taken to generate the final web pages (illustrated by the above diagram):</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Every day, a new <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/hackernews_daily/actions">Github Workflow</a> is spawned, kickstarting the entire process.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Update History</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first step is to get the past days best stories from the last successful run, and add the current best stories by
 reaching out to the Hacker News API to fetch the current list of best stories, removing the ones that were already featured, and adding the top ones to the current history
    <ul>
      <li>To persist the past best stories history, an <code>days_history.dat</code> artifact is created in every run, which is a simple <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html">Python Pickle</a> containing the story ids from the past days. These days are stored in form of a deque, in order to pop the older days as the history grows larger</li>
      <li>The final result of this step is a new <code>days_history.dat</code>, which will be used in the next step below, and will also serve as a base for the next workflow</li>
      <li>If a viable <code>days_history.dat</code> artifact cannot not be found in the previous successful runs, it is rebuilt by parsing the <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">Daemonology’s Hacker News Daily</a> web page</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Create Day/Story Models</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the story ids provided by the previously built <code>days_history.dat</code>, a list of hydrated days with their respective stories are built. These models will posteriorly provide all the information needed to create the final web page views
    <ul>
      <li>Each story is composed of an ID, title, story link, Hacker News discussion link, and its top comments. This information is obtained via the Hacker News API (example <a href="https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/25518730.json?print=pretty">call</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Create the <code>generated</code> folder. This is where the generated web pages and screenshots will be placed, in order to be later deployed to GitHub pages</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Gather Screenshots</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/">pyppeteer</a>, an headless browser is created to navigate through all the story links
    <ul>
      <li>A screenshot is taken for each of these pages (after attempting to dismiss a possible “Allow Cookies” prompt), and stored as PNGs in the <code>generated</code> folder</li>
      <li>Each of these screenshots are re-encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">WebP</a>, which allows for a smaller image footprint in browser’s that support it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If there is an unexpected error while processing the screenshots, it will not halt the overall workflow, since the final web pages can still function without screenshot images</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6</strong>. Generate Web Pages</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/">Jinja</a>, a templating engine for Python, is used to define and generate each of the final web pages. Four web pages are generated from a <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/hackernews_daily/blob/main/templates/page.html">single template</a>. These four variants are permutations of either presenting all past 10 days or not, and either showing images or not:
    <ul>
      <li>Latest day, with images</li>
      <li>Latest day, without images</li>
      <li>Past 10 days, with images</li>
      <li>Past 10 days, without images</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It was chosen to keep these in separate static web pages, in order to keep them simple, static, and without additional dynamic logic</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7.</strong> The <code>generated</code> folder is deployed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, which is deployed as a GitHub page, making these generated contents <a href="https://lopespm.github.io/hackernews_daily">publicly accessible</a></p>

<h1 id="source-code">Source Code</h1>

<p>The full source code is accessible at <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/hackernews_daily">https://github.com/lopespm/hackernews_daily</a> and the generated website at <a href="https://lopespm.github.io/hackernews_daily">https://lopespm.github.io/hackernews_daily</a>, feel free to improve it or to leave some feedback.</p>
