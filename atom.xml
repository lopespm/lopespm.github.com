Don’t postpone it.</p>

<p>This article provides concise, practical, straight to point suggestions on how to kick start your investment journey.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>Growing wealth has been vilified and correlated with the unscrupulous and greedy. Far from that, money is more than a number and currency: it provides options. The option to say <em>no</em> to that task / job you don’t want to do; options to provide for your family and close ones; options to give back to society and the world; options to support your health, well being and comfort. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>So why would you consider investing your hard earned money? Why do it as early as possible?</p>

<p>Let’s say you are 20 years old, and have zero net worth. No money in the bank, no assets. After that point, every month, <strong>for the next 30 years, you invest £250 every month</strong> (roughly equating to £8.4 per day). Let’s assume that investment yields a yearly 7% return on investment every year, on average (which is viable assumption, considering the SP500 historical performance). By 50 years old, this would be the <a href="https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/personal-finance/savings-investing/compound-interest-calculator">result</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contributions: £90,000 (250 * 12 * 30)</li>
  <li>Interest earned: £193,382 (thanks to compound interest you will gain this much. Einstein called compound percentages the 8th wonder of the world)</li>
  <li>Total: £283,382</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine how much higher these values could get if the invested values are increased. You can use this <a href="https://www.unbiased.co.uk/discover/personal-finance/savings-investing/compound-interest-calculator">calculator</a> to have an idea.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-game">Long term game</h2>

<p>Forget about get rich quick schemes. Going down that path would be comparable to buying lottery ticket and wish for a winning prize, but the odds of getting struck by lightning are nearly <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/leisure-recreation/powerball-mega-millions-or-a-lightning-strike-which-has-better-odds/882156">20,000 times higher</a> than hitting the winning numbers for the next Powerball jackpot.</p>

<p>Building wealth is a long term game which requires discipline, structure and time.</p>

<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>

<h2 id="create-an-emergency-fund">Create an emergency fund</h2>

<p>Make sure you have the equivalent of about 6 liquid months worth of your income available. Life is unpredictable, so make sure you have a reachable safety net which you can rely on and use promptly.</p>

<h2 id="pay-off-your-consumer-debts">Pay off your (consumer) debts</h2>

<p>Compound investment works both ways:  the more you invest, the more your wealth “snowball” will pick up along the way, growing exponentially. On the other hand, if you have debts that require you to pay interest, the inverse applies, progressively eating into your wealth.</p>

<p>As such, gather all your debts, order them by their interest rate, and make sure to pay the ones with the highest interest rate first. Prioritize non-equity based debts, such as credit card debts. Mortgages are equity based, so a portion of your payments goes towards your equity, so they would have less priority compared with pure consumer debt, but make sure they will not overburden you.</p>

<h2 id="budget">Budget</h2>

<p>Budgeting doesn’t mean living in extreme frugalness. Budgeting is about knowing what you <em>need</em> and <em>want</em>, and how much of your income would you be willing to allocate to them. Budgeting makes it easier to reason about your expenses, and having control over them, rather than them controlling you.</p>

<p>Make it as simple or complicated as you would want. You can start by putting in a sheet your monthly income, and subtract from it your fixed (e.g. rent, mortgage, internet bill) and variable expenses (e.g. entertainment, electricity bill, travel). In the end, the objective is that you have a better grasp of how much comes in / goes out. This will inform you on how much disposable income you will have available towards investments.</p>

<h2 id="automate">Automate</h2>

<p>Unless you are a professional trader, you don’t want to spend the entirety of your (limited) time and energy maintaining your investments. If so, that becomes a chore / job by itself. The whole point is to make money work for you, not the contrary.</p>

<p>So automate everything as much as possible. What you can’t automate, make it into a well defined process that requires minimal effort.</p>

<p>I suggested you review / maintain your investments only once per month, <em>every month</em>. If you are an employee, make this shortly after your paycheck comes in.</p>

<h2 id="systematize-know-where-your-assets-are-visit-them">Systematize. Know where your assets are. Visit them.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Every month, invest as much as possible from your income (this amount would be informed by your budget, and your risk appetite). You can also automate this process by scheduling a periodic amount from your bank account into your investment platform. I don’t particularly like this full automation strategy, since I prefer to adapt my investment amount to what I predict my spending will be on the following month, allowing for a tighter / more aggressive investment strategy. I personally prefer to have as little uninvested money as possible. YMMV.</li>
  <li>Make a spreadsheet. Doesn’t need to be fancy, just functional. It will only be used by you (in principle), so organize in however way you think it is best. Personally, I have different pages for each bank, trading platform, p2p platform, etc. Each of these pages has an history of the current invested amount in these platform, per month. Then an extra page summarizing / summing up all of these assets, with some optional graphs. Having this visual historical summary of all your assets in a single place is gratifying. Seeing how far you came on your investment journey, explicit in a graph, is incredibly fulfilling and powerful.</li>
  <li>Update this spreadsheet periodically, and re-balance your assets as needed. I recommend every month, right after you receive your salary. There are ways to do it automatically, but taking this time to go through all your assets provides visibility on any gaps and strategy changes that need to be done. Personally, this takes me one hour. That’s how long it takes to perform maintenance on my investments: <em>1 hour every month, that’s it</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="diversify-adapt-to-your-situation">Diversify. Adapt to your situation</h2>

<p>Having your investments diversified across different baskets allows you to balance your risks are diffuse your liabilities across different spaces, which ultimately protects you.</p>

<p>The strategy you would want to adopt for your investments in your 20s, likely won’t be the same as the strategy in your 60s. For example, later on in life, you might want to invest in safer investment vehicles, such as UK Government bonds (essentially, the country would need to go bankrupt for you to lose your money), savings accounts, cash ISAs and real estate.</p>

<h1 id="investment-vehicles">Investment Vehicles</h1>

<p>With our foundations in place, it’s time to dive into the nuts and bolts.</p>

<h2 id="max-out-your-workplace-pension">Max out your workplace pension</h2>

<p>Usually, if your are employed, your employer will make regular payments into your <a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/pensions-and-retirement/pensions-basics/the-different-pensions-you-can-get-if-you-live-and-work-in-the-uk">pension</a> pot on your behalf. And, depending on the plan you belong to, you may also make monthly contributions which will be taken from your salary. Some employers increase their contributions if you increase the monthly amount you put aside as well. This tends to be a direct match – if you put aside an extra 1%, they add an extra 1%, but there will be a maximum level they will match.</p>

<p>There are two allowances you should keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your annual allowance is the maximum level of total pension contributions to all of your pensions (made by yourself, your employer(s) or anyone else) that will receive tax relief in a tax year. It is currently £60,000, although could be lower if you have an adjusted income over £240,000 or you have already made a taxable withdrawal from any of your pension plans.</li>
  <li>The lump sum allowance (LSA) is the maximum amount of tax-free cash you can take from your pension savings in your lifetime. You can take 25% of your pot tax-free, as long as this amount is not higher than the LSA.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="own-the-world-stocks-etfs">Own the World: Stocks, ETFs</h2>

<p>Google, Apple, Tesla, NVIDIA: what if you could own a part of them and profit from their earnings by receiving dividends from them and / or getting capital gains from their (hopefully) raising share prices? </p>

<p>Turns out, you can. Either by buying their individual stocks, or better yet, you can invest on a index fund, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies">S&amp;P 500</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sp-500">S&amp;P 500</h3>

<p>S&amp;P 500 contains the top 500 U.S.A. publicly traded companies with a primary emphasis on market capitalization. Most interestingly, this list isn’t manually curated by a human or an opaque heuristic. The list is based on the market capitalization only, and it is considered one of the best gauges of large U.S. stocks and even the entire equities market because of its depth and diversity. This dilutes the risk you are exposed to, and historically has provided a realistic yearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500">~7.5%</a> return on investment.</p>

<p>You can’t invest directly in the S&amp;P 500 because it’s an index but you can invest in one of the many funds that use it as a benchmark and track its composition and performance.</p>

<p>To make it easier, you can get a S&amp;P 500 Exchange-traded fund (ETF). ETFs and index funds are similar in many ways but ETFs are considered to be more convenient to enter or exit.  They can be traded more easily than index funds and traditional mutual funds, similar to how common stocks are traded on a stock exchange.</p>

<p>Here are two S&amp;P 500 ETFs, which have a low maintenance cost:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9503/sp-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing">S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF - Distributing (VUSA)</a>: the dividends are paid out to you, and you can choose to reinvest them, invest them elsewhere, or just cash them out.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9694/sp-500-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating">S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF - Accumulating (VUAG)</a>: the dividends are automatically reinvested into the ETF, which makes the process more automatic, in case you want to reinvest your earnings (which likely, you should). Note that, even though these dividends are reinvested directly into the ETF, they are still <a href="https://monevator.com/income-tax-on-accumulation-unit/">considered as earnings by the HMRC</a>, so in the tax perspective, there is no difference between distributing and accumulating.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-etfs">Other ETFs</h3>

<p>Investing on a S&amp;P 500 is already a significant step up from plain low interest savings accounts, but you would be overly exposed to the U.S.A. market. As such, you can consider ETFs which further diversify your exposure, such as the <a href="https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9679/ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating">FTSE All-World UCITS ETF - (USD) Accumulating (VWRP)</a>, which is comprised of large and mid-sized company stocks in developed and emerging markets.</p>

<p>The above ETFs are provided by Vanguard (which tends to have low maintenance costs for their ETFs), and can be bought in several trading platforms, but there are many other reputable companies providing similar ETF, such as BlackRock.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-buy-these-stocks-and-etfs">Where to buy these Stocks and ETFs</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.justetf.com/uk/how-to/invest-in-uk.html">justetf</a>: is a great website to explore and get details on costs and performance of an ETF you are aiming to invest in</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/">Vanguard</a>: if you are starting out on your ETF investment journey, I strongly suggest this platform to invest in your ETFs. Making deposits and managing investments is straightforward and has the right amount of information and process, in order to not be overwhelming</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/home.php">Interactive Brokers</a>: this platform has been around for a long time, is low cost, well-capitalized, provides for very low cost exchange rates, and allows you to invest in a large amount of available stocks and ETFs. The trade-off is that it takes longer to onboard, due to its interface complexity and wide range of tools and information.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.trading212.com/">Trading212</a>: commission-free platform that doesn’t apply any commission on trades, but does charge <a href="https://www.trading212.com/cards">0.15% on currency conversion fees</a>. Make sure to take these hidden costs into account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vanguard, Interactive Brokers and Trading 212 are regulated in the UK by the FCA. I recommend you spread out your investments in different platforms, in order to reduce the risk / hassle in case any of them is shut down or rendered illiquid.</p>

<h2 id="isa">ISA</h2>

<p>Every time you sell the above ETFs or Stocks at a gain (for example, you bought £100 worth of an ETF, and then sold it for £150), and every time dividends are received (regardless if they are paid directly to you, or reinvested), you will need to pay taxes on them, unless you are still within their respective allowance. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>One way to not pay any of these taxes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, is to use a stocks and shares ISA. The stocks and shares ISA is one of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts">types of ISA</a>. Other ones being cash ISA (type of savings account that offers tax-free interest), innovative finance ISA (peer to peer lending with tax-free interest) and Lifetime ISA (tax-free savings account that gives a 25% bonus if used for retirement or to buy a first home).</p>

<p>As of the time of this writing, the maximum yearly amount allowed to be saved via ISAs is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts">£20,000</a>. This means that across any of the above 4 types of ISAs you can only deposit in them up to £20,000. You can withdraw them at any point in time. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Some specifics on this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a Stocks and Shares ISA is fairly straightforward. The above brokers (Vanguard, Interactive Brokers and Trading212), all allow for you to create a Stocks and Shares ISA account. This account is exactly the same as a normal / general account, except that it is tax sheltered. The ISA account would be separate from a general investment account you might want to create, in case you already reached your £20,000 limit, and want to continue investing (which I recommend).</li>
  <li>You can create ISA accounts in <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/stocks-shares-isas/">multiple providers</a> of any types you choose, but remember there is a global £20,000 limit. For example, if you have a Cash ISA on HSBC where you deposited £15,000, and Stocks and Shares ISA on Vanguard, you can only deposit up to £5,000 in Vanguard’s Stocks and Shares ISA account. You can transfer your ISA account across providers, to avoid losing your tax free investments.</li>
  <li>If you deposit £18,000 on a ISA account and then withdraw all of it, you will only be able to deposit £2,000 on a ISA account after that (on the same tax year<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>Every year, the annual ISA allowance will renew, and your investments from the previous year(s) will still have tax free gains. As such, avoid at all possible costs to withdraw your investments for these ISA accounts. Even if your ISA investment was made several years ago, their gains will still be tax free.</li>
  <li>Any capital gains and dividend gains yielded from your investments made in an ISA account will be tax free.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cashback">Cashback</h2>

<p>You can earn, while consuming. That is cashback.</p>

<p>The reason why this is possible in the first place, is because products are originally sold at a higher margin price, and cashback mechanisms are essentially a way to clawback part of that extra margin back to you. There are essentially two ways you can claim this: via credit cards (and bank accounts), cashback reward websites.</p>

<h3 id="credit-cards-and-bank-accounts">Credit cards (and bank accounts)</h3>

<p>There are several credit cards and bank accounts that allow you to gain cashback. Usually you can expect a 1% cashback rate, save from their respective promotional periods.</p>

<ul>
  <li>American Express (Amex) cards are overall the best when it comes to cashback rewards, such as the zero-fee <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-gb/credit-cards/platinum-cashback-everyday-credit-card">Amex Cashback Everyday Credit Card</a>. Trade-off being that not every establishment accepts Amex cards, so you will need a fall back.</li>
  <li>Since Amex cards are not accepted on all establishments, it is a good idea to have a backup Mastercard or Visa card, which are widely accepted. Have a browse through these <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/best-credit-card-rewards/">top cashback cards</a> to have an idea of what is available.</li>
  <li>There are credit cards which have pre-conditions, such as having minimum spend, an associated bank account, maintenance fee, amongst others, so make sure to take these into consideration to calculate your bottom-line</li>
  <li>There are credit cards which collect Avios instead, such as the <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-gb/credit-cards/ba-credit-card/">British Airways American Express® Credit Card</a>. Unless you plan to use them for travel, use their respective perks (e.g. lounge passes), and have spendings that are leveraged by these points, I would steer away from them. This is because there is an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8d7743f-0c81-4406-ad2d-0f84a2cc78a5">associated monetary value</a> with each of these points, and personally I prefer to have these saving readily available on cash.</li>
  <li>Remember to pay your credit card spending every month <em>in full</em>, otherwise you will be hit by the gargantuan interest rates (about 30%).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cashback-reward-sites">Cashback reward sites</h3>

<p>On top of the above credit card cashback rewards, you can clawback another layer of cashbacks via rewards sites. In the United Kingdom, the #1 site is <a href="https://www.topcashback.co.uk/">TopCashback</a>. To leverage it, just quickly search on their website if they offer rewards for a purchase you are about to make (e.g. hotel booking via Expedia, which easily gets you 10% cashback), use their link, and once you complete the purchase the reward will be available in a few weeks. This is incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>You can leverage other reward sites, such as the perks provided via Amex, that need to be activated, but personally, I wouldn’t bother too much with them.</p>

<h2 id="points--loyalty-cards">Points / loyalty cards</h2>

<p>Another level on top of the above cashback methods, is to use points cards on for your favorite merchants / supermarkets, which  can either provide you direct discounts, or accrue points that can be exchanged later on by discounts or perks. In general they are quick to set up, and their respective cards can be added to virtual wallets, so there is no need to carry their physical presence. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nectar.com/homepage">Nectar Card</a>: useful for Sainsbury’s purchases</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/my-waitrose/become-a-member">Waitrose Membership</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://secure.tesco.com/clubcard">Tesco Clubcard</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="watch--phone-wallet">Watch / Phone Wallet</h2>

<p>With all of the above credit and points cards, a wieldy and secure way to have them at hand is to add them to your watch or phone. Google and Apple devices largely support these wallets, and adding them is overall straightforward. One aspect I particularly like about this approach, is that carrying around credit cards using wallet appears feels more secure than carrying a physical card, which if stolen, the mechanisms available to block are mostly leveraged via the card provider, whereas via a virtual wallet, apart from have the card’s access walled by the device’s default access (e.g. pin code), the device can also be remotely wiped, if needed.</p>

<h2 id="equity-investments">Equity investments</h2>

<p>Seed investment on companies (such as startups) is not restricted to angel investors and VCs. These investments are now widely available via crowdfunding platforms such as <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">Crowdcube</a> or <a href="https://europe.republic.com/">Seedrs / Republic</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>These platforms allow you to contribute towards a round of investment in a given company.</li>
  <li>This is a high risk, high reward / loss business proposition, since there are only very specific conditions in which you can withdraw your investment (e.g. company is acquired, gets IPOed). There is a high likelihood that these companies either take a long time span to <em>exit</em>, or that they will go bankrupt.</li>
  <li>Many of these are covered by a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-tax-relief-for-investors">tax relief</a>, such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-for-the-enterprise-investment-scheme">Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)</a>, meaning that you can deduce a percentage of your investment from your taxes. For example, if you invest £100 of a company under the EIS scheme, you will be able to deduce £30 (30% of £100) from your taxes (if you do not expect to pay that amount of taxes, then this would not be useful for you).</li>
  <li>Commonly there are associated perks provided by the companies, such as redeemable vouchers on their businesses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-vehicles">Other vehicles</h2>

<p>Other investment vehicles you can consider are real estate (e.g. buy to let, REIT), commodity trading (e.g. silver, gold), forex trading (buying one currency and selling another while attempting to profit from the trade), crypto trading, p2p lending. Even though I have some experience with some of them, these are not my main focus of my investment strategy, so I’ll abstain from making many remarks on them.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>The above guide is not extensive, by all means, and there are thousands of ways to put your money to work effectively, but it is important to not go overboard and over optimize, as too much time spent on these will eventually carve away from other meaningful areas of your life, such as overly obsessing over points optimizations. This is an eventual opportunity cost, and you should be aware that these methods are a means, not the end. Optimize just enough, automate as much as possible, reap the rewards, gain options, and enjoy your life to fullest!</p>

<h2 id="why-was-this-project-assembled-in-the-first-place">Why was this project assembled in the first place?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve built up a considerable personal database:
    <ul>
      <li>For more than 15 years I’ve been journaling and writing several notes, keeping them aggregated in the same place as I changed their hosting platform. From simple text files, passing by Evernote, and more recently into <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, into which I migrated all of my written notes <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
      <li>Most of my relevant correspondence for almost 10 years has been made via WhatsApp, which stores all messages locally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I’ve realized how powerful it is to reflect on past events and approach them with the lenses of the new experiences and lessons I’ve been accumulating throughout life, but due to the considerable amount of content present in the above data stores, sometimes it is hard to reach and associate the relevant information I am looking for, even though I try to keep the above relatively organized.</li>
  <li>And of course, how great would it be to have a personal assistant with access to all of these, in a self-contained offline fashion?
    <ul>
      <li>Currently, state of the art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">Llama3</a> are feasible to be run locally on a laptop, which is something that still blows my mind.</li>
      <li>Pre-trained LLMs can have their capabilities augmented (as we will see below) to serve different custom purposes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of this combined meant that it would be feasible to host a state of the art LLM in my laptop, with potential access to my personal files, without requiring this sensitive information to be hosted or processed elsewhere, which was something that had quite an appeal for me.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Build an offline assistant with access to WhatsApp messages and Obsidian notes (or any other data sources), using components that don’t fully abstract the process (similar to the approach I took when <a href="https://lopespm.com/machine_learning/2016/10/06/deep-reinforcement-learning-racing-game.html">creating a deep reinforcement learning agent to play a racing game</a>), to learn more about how LLMs and their infrastructures work.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="building-blocks">Building Blocks</h1>

<h2 id="running-an-offline-llm">Running an offline LLM</h2>

<p>One of the crucial pieces is actually being able to run an LLM locally. Below we will explore the hardware requirements, and software we can use.</p>

<h3 id="the-more-gpu-cores-and-vram-the-better">The more GPU cores and VRAM, the better</h3>

<p>When running LLMs on a personal computer, there are two main factors that influence its inference performance and overall capability to even being able to run them: number of GPU cores, and available VRAM (video RAM, this is, memory available to the GPU).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The more GPU cores available, the more operations can be processed, and machine learning algorithms are all about just finding patterns in numbers</li>
  <li>The more (VRAM) memory available, the bigger the model can be stored in memory and be efficiently processed. For example, if we consider Llama3 with 8 billion parameters (more information in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpYqED1q6ro">this video</a>) <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:
    <ul>
      <li>One 32 bit float value = 32 bits of memory, this is, 4 bytes (1 byte = 8 bits)</li>
      <li>8 billion parameters = 8.000.000.000 * 4 bytes = 32.000.000.000 bytes ≈ 32GB VRAM, for a full precision model (32 bit float)</li>
      <li>If we would use a quantized model, this is, using lower precision floats to represent the parameters:</li>
      <li>Using half precision 16 bit float parameters: 16 GB VRAM</li>
      <li>Using quarter precision, 8 bit float parameters: 8 GB VRAM</li>
      <li>And if we would use Llama 70 billion parameters, it would amount to 280 GB VRAM (float32), 140 GB VRAM (float16), 70 GB VRAM (float8), 35 GB VRAM(float4)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I personally own a MacBook Pro M3 Max with 40 GPU cores and 128GB of unified RAM (meaning that this memory is available to the CPU and GPU), and it just so happens that Apple Silicon computers (M1, M2, M3 chips) are very capable machines to run inference on LLMs, such as Llama3 8B (full precision), or even 70B models (I’ve personally tested the 70B 4bit model <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> on this machine, and can attest that it runs well and in bounds of memory available, as seen on the calculations above)</p>

<h3 id="running-the-inference">Running the inference</h3>

<p>There are several methods or libraries that can be used for running a LLM in a personal computer. One of the most approachable ones is <a href="https://www.ollama.com/">ollama</a>, which effortlessly allows you (after a quick installation step), to run Llama 3, Phi 3, Mistral, Gemma offline on your computer.</p>

<p>Another possible way is to load the model’s definition from Hugging Face (think of it roughly as a GitHub for machine learning models), and run them via the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/transformers/">transformers</a> library, which vividly encourage you to explore. The amount of freely available pre-trained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio is inspiring, to say the least.</p>

<p>For this project, a third option was picked, which was using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-lm/">mlx_lm</a> library, that essentially still leverages the Hugging Face Hub to provide the models, but optimizes execution by leveraging <a href="https://unfoldai.com/mlx-ml-on-apple-silicon/">MLX</a>, an array framework crafted specifically for harnessing the power of Apple silicon, which was developed by Apple’s machine learning research team.</p>

<h2 id="augmenting-the-llms-knowledge">Augmenting the LLM’s Knowledge</h2>

<p>Now that our LLM is running locally, the question that follows is: how to make it aware of all the contents present in Obsidian notes and WhatsApp messages? We have a few options:</p>

<h3 id="retrain--fine-tune-a-pre-trained-llm">1. Retrain / fine tune a pre-trained LLM</h3>

<p>The idea here is to retrain / fine tune the entire model, or parts of it, to make it knowledgeable about our contents.</p>

<p>A pre-trained LLM comes with the advantage of common probabilistic knowledge about a language or set of languages that can be leveraged upon, which was a result of a long and costly training process. As such, a full retraining of the model that would not retain information about its trained parameters would be out of the question. Instead, there are several ways we can leverage it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freeze the existing LLM layers (all or a selection of them), add also add new trainable layer layers on top of the existing LLM layers, and only train the trainable and unfreezed ones.</li>
  <li><a href="https://llama.meta.com/docs/how-to-guides/fine-tuning/">Fine tune</a> the existing pre-trained LLM, which essentially modifies all parameters of the model with a low training rate, in order to retain as much existing knowledge and capabilities as much as possible, and avoid <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.18865v1">catastrophic forgetting</a>. Because these models are so massive, they are not particularly sensitive to any given parameters being off by a lot, or a little. Their overall size and complexity make up for it, so we can mostly get away with rough updates. To fine tune a model, there are essentially two ways to go about it:
    <ul>
      <li>Load all of the model’s parameters into memory, and modify them directly during the learning process</li>
      <li>Take advantage of the fact that you can multiply two small matrices to get a larger matrix (which is the main bread and butter of deep learning models), so we can try to find out the two smaller matrices instead, meaning that we only need to maintain those in memory. All the parameters of the model are still modified during training, but we don’t need to hold them all in memory at once. That’s what Low-Rank Adaptation (<a href="https://www.entrypointai.com/blog/lora-fine-tuning/">LoRA</a>) fine-tuning method does, and it is one of the most popular ways to fine tune LLMs, along with its QLoRA counterpart (which uses a data type that reduces by 4x the already lower LoRA memory footprint).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some important aspects of these techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We are compressing our documents into the LLMs internal knowledge, and we have less control of how precisely these models retain the most accurate information. These could lead to hallucinations.</li>
  <li>If the data we want to augment our LLM with is dynamic in nature (which for our case, I would prefer it to be, so that the assistant can have access to the most relevant information when used), this would mean that the model would need to be fine tuned every time an update should be made.</li>
  <li>The training data needs to be structured in a way that makes sense for the model to be used. For example, WhatsApp messages and Obsidian notes would need to be transformed into a sensible training set that would fit the tone I would aim to have for the assistant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that I would want to experiment with different types of assistants and different ways to leverage and explore the data in a conversational way, and have access to the most up to date information available, which could be available in several different formats (for example, let’s say I would like to augment the LLMs knowledge with historical CO2 readings of my apartment), retraining / fine tuning the model was not a very inviting approach.</p>

<h3 id="insert-all-documents-into-the-prompt-as-context">2. Insert all documents into the prompt, as context</h3>

<p>The idea here is to provide all the context that LLM needs, in the <a href="https://llama.meta.com/docs/how-to-guides/prompting/">prompt’s context</a>. For example:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
&lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;system&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;

You are a AI assistant which answers the user's question based on your prior knowledge
and a collection of the user's documents.

Each of the documents has the format &lt;&lt;document:||document_name||&gt;&gt;||content||.
||document_name|| represents the document name. ||content|| represents the
document's content. Don't show the &lt;&lt;document:||document_name||&gt;&gt; portion to the user.

For example, for: &lt;&lt;document:&lt;obsidian&gt;:hello world&gt;&gt;This is an interesting
description of hello.
- ||document_name|| is &lt;obsidian&gt;:hello world
- ||content|| This is an interesting description of hello.

These are the user's documents:
----------
&lt;&lt;document:&lt;obsidian&gt;:lamas running down the street&gt;&gt;The content for lamas
going down the street
&lt;&lt;document:&lt;obsidian&gt;:alpacas running down the street&gt;&gt;That time when I saw a
alpaca running down the street.
----------

&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;user&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;Tell me about that time I've seen animals
running down the street&lt;|eot_id|&gt;

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br />
This would be the most convenient approach, but the context window available to a LLM, the number of tokens it can use at one time to generate a response, is limited.</p>

<p>Llama3 8B for example, allows for a 8K token context window, and there have been attempts to extend it further to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19553">80K</a> or <a href="https://huggingface.co/gradientai/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k">262K</a>, and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro can handle a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#architecture">1 million token context window</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Given that my Obsidian notes total around 8M characters in content, and my WhatsApp messages around 16M, even if we assume that an average of 1 <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1789590397749957117">token</a> per 4 characters, just the Obsidian notes would clock around 2M tokens, which makes this method infeasible</p>

<h3 id="rag-retrieval-augmented-generation">3. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)</h3>

<p>To navigate around the context window limitation, instead of inserting all the documents into the prompt’s context in one go, we can instead be selective on the information we want to provide on the prompt, depending on the user’s request(s).</p>

<p>For example, if the user asks the AI assistant “what do you think about that gaming project I did 4 years ago?”, behind the scenes we can query a database, and ask it the most relevant results about gaming projects that happened about 4 years ago, and then use those documents content into the prompt’s context.</p>

<p>That’s the overall idea of RAG.</p>

<p>Now, many questions come up:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Transforming a conversation into a query:</em> How do we transform the user’s prompt + the context of the conversation, into a query that asks our database exactly what the main LLM needs to provide a contextual reply?</li>
  <li><em>Fetching contents related to a query:</em> How can the content database know which are the most relevant content related to a given query?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s explore these in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-rag-tick">What makes RAG tick?</h2>

<h3 id="transforming-a-conversation-into-a-query">1. Transforming a conversation into a query</h3>

<p>In order to produce a query that transforms an entire conversation into a concise sentence that can be used to get the documents in the database that are most similar to it, we can feed in the conversation into a LLM specialized in creating summarized queries. Here is an example of prompt we can use for it:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;system&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;   
You are the user's document keeper that has access to all the documents for the user.
Based on the entire conversation only, you will only reply with the question you
will ask to query the appropriate user documents, in order to get all the relevant
user's documents related to the conversation.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;

&lt;&lt; entire conversation &gt;&gt;

&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;document keeper&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br />
This is how it would it would look like with actual information about the conversation:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;system&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;   
You are the user's document keeper that has access to all the documents for the user.
Based on the entire conversation only, you will only reply with the question you
will ask to query the appropriate user documents, in order to get all the relevant
user's documents related to the conversation.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;

&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;
Hi there! I\'m a helpful AI assistant with access to your documents. What can I do for you today?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;
&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;user&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;
What is the name of the first steam game I developed?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;
&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;
Survival Ball, which you published in 2018
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;
&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;user&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;
which interesting things could you tell me about it?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;

&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;document keeper&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br />
This LLM’s reply would be <code>Which are interesting facts about Survival Ball, a game developed in 2008?</code>.</p>

<h3 id="fetching-contents-related-to-a-query">2. Fetching contents related to a query</h3>

<p>Now that we have a query, such as “Which are interesting facts about Survival Ball, a game developed in 2008?”, how can we get the documents (Obsidian notes and/or WhatsApp messages) that are most relevant with that query?</p>

<p>One possible way would be to perform a custom decomposition of the query phrase, and attempt to look for documents that most referenced similar words to the query. This custom search would be brittle, require careful heuristics to match these, and would not completely take into account what that sentence means, and therefore the matching between query and documents would be likely unreliable.</p>

<p>Instead, we have a much more powerful concept at our disposal, which will help us perform this matching: text embeddings.</p>

<h4 id="text-embeddings">Text embeddings</h4>

<p>The idea behind text embeddings is that if we transform a given piece of text into a vector that is in close proximity to other vectors that have a similar meaning, then from a given query text we can get the most conceptually similar pieces of text to it. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, if the vectors representing our text were trained to be closer together when they rhyme, then close to the word “dog”, we might have the word “fog” closer to it, but “cat” further away; and conversely, if we trained these to represent their conceptual meaning, then for the word “dog”, we might see the word “cat” nearer to it, but “floor” further away <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>A mind-boggling implication is that we can perform algebraic expressions on these vectors. For example, if our vectors were trained to represent the meaning of the text we could have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The classical example is that if grab the vectors for king, woman and man, and perform this operation: <code>(king + woman) - man</code>, the closest vector could be <code>queen</code></li>
  <li><code>(London + Japan) - England -&gt; Tokyo</code></li>
  <li><code>(boat - fly) - airplane -&gt; sail</code></li>
  <li><code>(cow - oink) - pig -&gt; moos</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise, if we probe which are the closest pieces of text related to <code>dog</code>, we could get <code>dogs, puppy, pit_bull, pooch</code></p>

<p>These examples were takes from an actual working <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">word2vec</a> model that was trained on a google news dataset, which I invite you to explore in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qxnNUojAzIniOXwFZi4y7NlWk4cTzIMZ?usp=sharing">Google Colab notebook</a>.</p>

</center>

<p>For our project’s objective, the most relevant property is the latter one. Given query text, we would transform it into a vector, and get the closest vectors in our document (vector) database, which in our project will be supported by a PostgreSQL database using the <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector">pgvector</a> extension. More about this below.</p>

<h1 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h1>

<p>With the prior knowledge for the previous section, we are now in a position to build an system architecture that would best fit our objective:</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/architecture.png"><img src="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/architecture.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Personal LLM Architecture </figcaption></figure>

<p>The overall idea is that we have a Llama3 8B LLM powering the main AI assistant, which has its knowledge augmented via RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) by using another Llama3 8B LLM to generate queries used to retrieve documents from a vector database powered by PostgreSQL. These retrieved documents are then added to the main LLM’s context, and the LLM generates a response based on the retrieved documents + user’s prompt + ongoing conversation. Below are further details for these.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First <em>prepare documents and store them</em> in a vector database.</li>
  <li>and then, when using the chat interface, <em>evaluate the user’s input and conversation</em>, query the vector database for relevant documents, add them as context into the main LLMs prompt, which will output the response that the user will see.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="document-preparation-and-storage">Document preparation and storage</h2>

<p>Before anything else, all Obsidian notes and WhatsApp messages are exported, parsed, transformed into text embeddings, and inserted into the vector database.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-the-data-sources">1. Exporting the data sources</h3>

<p>No export procedure is required for Obsidian, since it stores its text contents inside markdown (<code>.md</code>) files, we just need to point directly to the folder we want to target, which can be a vault’s root folder, for example.</p>

<p>For WhatsApp messages, a <code>result.json</code> holding a structured JSON dump of all messages and their respective metadata, is generated via an open source exporting utility which extracts all messages from the local WhatsApp database present in the mobile device; and a <code>contacts.csv</code> is exported from all Google contacts, in order to enrich the context of the aforementioned messages. A step-by-step process to generate these is described <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-of-data-sources">in the repo’s Readme</a></p>

<h3 id="parse-vectorize-and-persist">2. Parse, vectorize and persist</h3>

<p>With our data sources ready, we can now start extracting relevant information, transforming the relevant content into a vector, and then persist into a vector database. The entire process is made by running:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ python create_and_persist_embeddings.py
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Each of the separate Obsidian note paragraphs and WhatsApp messages are accumulated into a single entry, so that locally close contextual content can be readily available and provided to the main LLM AI assistant, when retrieved, so that it has better immediately relevant contextual information about a given topic. It was chosen to accumulate a set of note paragraphs / messages that in total would not surpass the maximum content length of the model used to vectorize the content, which in this case has a maximum content length of 514 (see how to get the maximum content length <a href="https://gist.github.com/lopespm/342bd297f0cd6a2819f69a1ea10e7777">here</a>).</p>

<p>All of these are <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/create_and_persist_embeddings.py#L7">batch processed</a>, so that vector embedding creation can be done much more efficiently. Given that in total there were 25M characters worth of content across these two data sources, these optimizations make a substantial change in the processing run time. Further optimizations could be made in optimizing <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/create_and_persist_embeddings.py#L33-L36">DB insertion commits</a> and streaming each of the data sources contents, instead of storing them entirely into memory.</p>

<h4 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h4>

<p>The python script calls into a <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/obsidian_to_embeddings.py">custom module</a> that traverses through all the markdown (<code>.md</code>) files inside Obsidian’s root folder and its respective descendent folders, and accumulate a group of lines in a given file into a distinct entry.</p>

<p>For example, a Obsidian note called <code>Survival Ball TV.md</code> with this content</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Only had to take OUYA project, change some resources to match Android TV controllers, detect Nexus Remote.
Test on the Nexus Player
Delete all OUYA related resources
Most of the time was spent (...)
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Would be broken down into to two separate database entries <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry 1.
    <ul>
      <li>DB ID of the entry</li>
      <li>Content: <code>Only had to take OUYA project, change some resource (...)</code> - these would be first lines of the note</li>
      <li>Source: <code>&lt;obsidian&gt;:Survival Ball TV</code></li>
      <li>Embedding: the vector representation the content text (content attribute above)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Entry 2.
    <ul>
      <li>DB ID of the entry</li>
      <li>Content: <code>Unity is pretty great, and has tons of really great stuff (...)</code> - the lines coming after the ones in Entry 1. above</li>
      <li>Source: <code>&lt;obsidian&gt;:Survival Ball TV</code></li>
      <li>Embedding: the vector representation of the content text (content attribute above)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/obsidian_db_entry2.png"><img src="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/obsidian_db_entry2.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Sample Obsidian entries in the vector database <sup>6</sup> </figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h4>

<p>Likewise, the script also calls into a <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/whatsapp_to_embeddings.py">custom module</a> that traverses all the messages, and similarly to the approach taken above for Obsidian notes, a set of messages are aggregated into a single entry.</p>

<p>For example, a WhatsApp conversation on the “Deeper Conversations” chat group would be broken down into several different entries, such as [^6]:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry 1.
    <ul>
      <li>DB ID of the entry</li>
      <li>Content: <code>message from "Deeper Conversations 💭" to me, on 2021-06-26 10:15:44: And that’s absolutely normal (...)</code> - several lines of the conversation would be aggregated here</li>
      <li>Source: <code>&lt;whatsapp&gt;:xxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyy@t.as</code> (the numbers were redacted)</li>
      <li>Embedding: the vector representation of the content text (content attribute above)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Entry 2.
    <ul>
      <li>DB ID of the entry</li>
      <li>Content: <code>message from "Deeper Conversations 💭" to me, on 2021-07-04 18:37:54: Challenge yourself (...)</code> - another group of several lines of the conversation would be aggregated here</li>
      <li>Source: <code>&lt;whatsapp&gt;:xxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyy@t.as</code> (the numbers were redacted)</li>
      <li>Embedding: the vector representation of the content text (content attribute above)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Entry 3., 4., etc would have a similar structure to the ones above</li>
</ul>

<p>The storage of the above entries is handled by a PostgreSQL database using the <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector">pgvector</a> extension, which allows PostgreSQL to store and query vector attributes, and notably for our project, it provides tha capability to query for the closest vectors / entries related to a given query vector via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine similarity</a> <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The database is hosted via a docker container, which makes it easily encapsulated and quick to set up and run.</p>

<h2 id="embedding-model">Embedding model</h2>

<p>As we <a href="https://lopespm.com/machine_learning/2024/06/24/personal-llm.html#text-embeddings">discussed above</a>, embedding models can be trained have their embedding representation to be optimized and better suit the problem at hand. In general, there are several types of tasks a embedding can be better or worse at, so testing each single model against our problem would certainly inefficient.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a Massive Text Embedding Benchmark was been made and its results are freely available <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">in this dashboard</a>, which compares several models against capabilities such as classification, clustering and reranking.</p>

  <li>Good average score across the all tasks (ranking 20th overall)</li>
  <li>And most notably support 100 different languages, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02116">one of them being Portuguese</a>, which is quite relevant since my notes and messages are largely a mix of English and Portuguese, with some sprinkles of other languages (which this model also supports)</li>

<h2 id="evaluation-phase">Evaluation phase</h2>

<p>Having all the documents vectorized and available in a database, we can now jump into the evaluation phase, in which we leverage upon these on chat conversation with an AI assistant.</p>

<p>To start the chat session, we only need to activate the respective conda environment <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> and execute:</p>

<h3 id="the-main-ai-assistant-llm">1. The main AI Assistant LLM</h3>

<p>Upon starting the above script, a Llama3 8B model (<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-4bit">mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-4bit</a>) is loaded into memory and is instructed to behave as AI assistant / philosopher / psychotherapist (or any other role one so wishes, as <a href="https://lopespm.com/machine_learning/2024/06/24/personal-llm.html#results">seen below</a>, and the user is greeted with an initial message, and is able to start inserting a prompt.</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/greeting.png"><img src="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/greeting.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> Greeting message from the AI assistant </figcaption></figure>

<p>This will be LLM having the conversation with the user.</p>

<h3 id="transform-conversation-into-db-query">2. Transform conversation into DB query</h3>

<p>Once the user inserts their prompt, the entire conversation is provided to an auxiliary “document keeper” LLM, which has only one job: transform the entire conversation the user is having with the main AI assistant into concise sentence that aims to represent the information we are interested to provide as context on the upcoming reply.</p>

<p>The document keeper LLM produces a query sentence <a href="https://lopespm.com/machine_learning/2024/06/24/personal-llm.html#transforming-a-conversation-into-a-query">using the previously described process</a> (related <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/formulate_query_for_retrieving_content.py">source code</a>), and then transforms it into a vector using the <a href="https://lopespm.com/machine_learning/2024/06/24/personal-llm.html#embedding-model">embedding model</a>.</p>

<p>Now we have everything we need. Using this vector representation of the query, we can ask the database which are the top 10 entries which have their respective vectors closest to the query vector.</p>

<p>So for example, if the text query created by the “document keeper” LLM is <code>Which are interesting facts about Survival Ball, a game developed in 2008?</code> (resulting in a vector representation of [1.3, 4.2, 3.3, etc]), then a <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/retrieve_related_content_from_db.py">SQL query such as this one would be made against the DB</a>:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">

<p>Now that we have the retrieved a set of relevant entries we want the main AI assistant LLM to consider towards its reply, we now can add them as context for the prompt for the main AI assistant LLM, very similarly to what was <a href="https://lopespm.com/machine_learning/2024/06/24/personal-llm.html#insert-all-documents-into-the-prompt-as-context">described above</a>:</p>

You are a AI assistant which answers the user's question based on your prior knowledge
and a collection of the user's documents.

Each of the documents has the format &lt;&lt;document:||document_name||&gt;&gt;||content||.
||document_name|| represents the document name. ||content|| represents the
document's content. Don't show the &lt;&lt;document:||document_name||&gt;&gt; portion to the user.

For example, for: &lt;&lt;document:&lt;obsidian&gt;:hello world&gt;&gt;This is an interesting
description of hello.
- ||document_name|| is &lt;obsidian&gt;:hello world
- ||content|| This is an interesting description of hello.

These are the user's documents:
----------
&lt;&lt;document:&lt;obsidian&gt;:lamas running down the street&gt;&gt;The content for lamas
going down the street
&lt;&lt;document:&lt;obsidian&gt;:alpacas running down the street&gt;&gt;That time when they saw a

<h3 id="output-from-the-ai-assistant-llm-presented-to-the-user">4. Output from the AI assistant LLM presented to the user</h3>

<p>We now have everything we need, and the prompt is ready to be <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/main.py">evaluated by the main LLM</a>.</p>

<p>Once the prompt is evaluated by this LLM, we present the output to the user, and then we cycle through the entire evaluation phase again once the user submits their request.</p>

<p>Overall, I’ve found interactions with this AI to be quite interesting, even though sometimes it can output blobs of information that could be cleaner or have better answers. The former can be addressed by tweaking the prompts (i.e. prompt engineering) having increased efficacy towards the behavior I aim the Ai to have, and the latter by either cleaning Obsidian notes directly, or improving the data processing and extraction. Regardless, I find these results to be quite pleasing, useful and even amusing.</p>

<p>For example, the code allows you to choose the AI’s persona by changing <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/main.py#L8-L10">this constant</a></p>

<h2 id="adding-other-data-sources">Adding other data sources</h2>

<p>This project focuses on using Obsidian notes and WhatsApp messages to augment the main LLM, but virtually any piece of content could be used to augment it. CO2 historical readings, tax documents, financial statements, diplomas, official documents, calendar events, etc. Sky is the limit.</p>

<p>Doing so in practice would be as straightforward as adding an <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/personal_llm/blob/main/create_and_persist_embeddings.py">additional module to this script</a>, and have it return the pieces relevant pieces of content, and then re-run:</p>

<h2 id="inspiring-wealth-of-possibilities">Inspiring wealth of possibilities</h2>

<p>This type of assistant has been something I’ve been daydreaming for a long time, and having the peace of mind that I have full control and customization of it is something that profoundly satisfies me. Not only that, this entire project has an immense learning opportunity for me, and as I researched through it and pieced the puzzle pieces together, I’ve felt humbled and inspired by the explosive amount of possibilities that these models provide.</p>

<p>For example, just browsing through the <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">wealth of freely available models</a>, ready to be used, combined and assembled into different scenarios, leaves me at awe:</p>

<figure class="image"><center><a href="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/hugging_face_models.png"><img src="https://lopespm.com/files/personal_llm/hugging_face_models.png" /></a></center><figcaption class="media-caption"> A sample of different classes of models available in Hugging Face.

<p>I find it fulfilling to learn about a subject by fundamentally understanding its core components, hence the usage of several lower level components, <a href="https://lopespm.com/machine_learning/2016/10/06/deep-reinforcement-learning-racing-game.html">similar to how I previously built a deep reinforcement learning agent</a>), but there are several readily available tools and libraries that handle a lot of the heavy lifting:</p>

As a language model integration framework, LangChain’s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis. This could have been used to abstract most, if not all, of the RAG heavy lifting, which is quite useful.</li>

      <p>Obsidian is an amazing platform / app which I vividly recommend. I’ve recently migrated all of my notes from Evernote into Obsidian, and couldn’t be happier. Obsidian stores all of the notes in plain <code>.md</code> files that are yours to keep, and allows you to completely customize it to your heart’s desire.

      <p>The process of how these embedding models are trained is a fascinating topic by itself. The idea behind it is that you place a given piece of text on the model’s input and on its corresponding contextual word on the output, and then train the model to attempt to correctly predict the output text. For example, if using a word2vec skip-gram architecture, the input is a single word and the output is trained to be the words around it. The model’s number of weights is lower than the number of pieces of text in the dictionary, so that the model is forced to compress these associations into its weights. Once the model is trained, we use its learned weights to generate an embedding for a given piece of text. When a model is trained on large swathes of text, this simple method yields incredible results.<a href="#fnref:4" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>In practice, representing these vectors as being closer together when they rhyme, vs when they are conceptually closer, can be achieved by training the embedding model on poetry books and giving higher emphasis on the last words of each line for the former, and training the embedding model on more generic text datasets, such as wikipedia, and using samples around the seed word uniformly as target words (using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">skip-gram</a> architecture for example) for the latter.<a href="#fnref:5" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="einsteins-rambles">Einstein’s rambles</h2>

<p>I’ve been listening to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Einstein-Life-Universe-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1847390544">“Einstein: His Life and Universe”</a> audiobook, from Walter Isaacson, which recounts a series of curious stories of how he carried himself through his life.</p>

<p>Einstein was often known to be aloof and lost in this thoughts, so much so that when sailing his clunky 15-foot sailboat named Tinef (Yiddish for “worthless” or “junk”), he often found himself to being rescued more than once by locals near to his rented a summer cottage overlooking Cutchogue Harbor.</p>

<p>Another delightful story was when he lived in Princeton, where occasionally, he would take rambling walks on his own. One day, called into the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked, and asked to speak to a particular dean. When the secretary said that the dean wasn’t available, he hesitantly asked for Einstein’s home address. That was not possible to give out, he was informed. His voice then dropped to a whisper. “Please don’t tell anybody,” he said, “but I am Dr. Einstein, I’m on my way home, and I’ve forgotten where my house is.”</p>

<h2 id="thinking-in-safety">Thinking, in safety</h2>

<p>Over the past years, I’ve made a habit of having at least one long walk / hike every weekend. I take immense joy - if I happen to go by myself and I’m not actively listening to an audio book or am concentrating on some task - to just wander around and immerse myself in random thoughts, think about hard problems, strategise, and attempt to arrive at sound conclusions. This mental wandering, almost like a meditation, I am sure that happens for most of us, in several instances. Maybe when waking up, during the shower, during a walk, during a boring talk, when contemplating art or nature, etc.</p>

<p>Since we are not omniscient and omnipresent, we have several limitations in knowing how a given action will translate into a set of consequences, so we use probabilistic models and heuristics in our thought processes to discern which are the most likely actions that will help us arrive at a desirable outcome. And the more relevant information and time we have to process our thoughts, the better our results will be.</p>

<p>In all of these, I believe there is one common denominator that is fundamental for that process to happen: safety.</p>

<h2 id="the-influence-of-ones-environment">The influence of one’s environment</h2>

<p>Let’s assume you live with access to information and resources (food, money, shelter, etc), but are living in a situation where your surrounding environment requires you to keep alert and attentive to hazard to your physical / mental wellbeing, or you are in a situation where your social stability is dependent on incapacitating amounts of your energy and time. This could be due to living in a dangerous neighborhood, having overly demanding peers, an abusive household, etc.</p>

<p>Even though there might be a series of limited actions one could take to improve their situation, the constant fight-or-flight severely restricts the opportunities where these action plans can be considered, which eventually leads to reactive actions that could have a number of possible outcomes (good or bad), rather than surgical long term actions that would pave the path towards positive outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaway">The takeaway</h2>

<p>While many many situations are not under our control, such as our initial conditions, birth place, etc, which place a default upper bound on any possible outcomes, we do have agency over some parts of our life, and that is what we can focus on. The path to unwanted consequences is a slippery slope made of several small decisions, some under our control, others not. But for the ones we have the opportunity to control, we should.</p>

<p>For example, the peers one <em>choses</em> to have around, the <em>choice</em> to avoid short term pleasures that have a high long term cost, the <em>choice</em> of which country or neighborhood to live in, the <em>choice</em> of which job offer to strive for, etc.</p>

<p>Do notice that the italics are intentional. The <em>choices</em> above assume that those are options you have under your control to pick, which I am conscious that is not always the case.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined.</p>

  <p><em>― Yuval Noah Harari</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a minute to think of what a nation is. Let’s say the United States of America. What makes someone American? Is it their physique, genetic traits, family lineage, pheromones? No, it’s a concept in their head, which stems from a mix of identity, ideology, personal gains from abiding to that concept (say, gaining currency via a job or a company, that allows you to acquire things you desire), perceived protection and support from peers because they believe you are commonly aligned on core beliefs / concepts.</p>

<p>The same can be said of a company. A company is not a physical being, it’s a shared idea in our imagination. As Yuval mentions in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0099590085">Sapiens</a>, Peugeot does not really exist, except in our minds. It doesn’t have a body, mind, anything. We have the common belief that Peugeot exists, because we also have the common belief of what a company means, we are aligned on how it should be represented and who can represent it, we recognize it as an entity with rights and duties, and which laws it should abide by.</p>

<p>Laws, as well, are worth nothing if only one person believes in them. They are powerful because a large group of people believe in them, and they expect others to do so as well. That’s why we have courts, prisons, and educational systems for that matter. They are ways to punish, format, and incentivise for the entire group to have the required level of consistency, and keep rowing in the same direction.</p>

<p>That’s why complete anarchy loses its edge on a large scale. It extinguishes the biggest thing Humans have going for them: the ability for large numbers of people to rally in common goals, even though they don’t personally know most of their fellow believers.</p>

<p>As N. K. Humphrey suggests, these ideas, behaviors, or styles that spread by means of imitation from person to person within a culture, also known as memes, could even be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically. The generational propagation of a meme outweighs the lifespan of the Human who created it, so in a way, <em>“we are living inside the dreams of dead people”</em>, as Yuval puts it.</p>

<p>That being said, how do we align on a common concept or belief?</p>

<h2 id="stories">Stories</h2>

<p>We’ve seen above how powerful and valuable having a broad range of concepts aligned within a group of people. They bring value to the whole, but also to the individual.</p>

<p>You can force someone to abide to a given concept via force (coercion, blackmailing, etc), but since they see little value going on for them, they don’t have the incentive to grow that concept inside them, or to propagate that concept to others</p>

<p>Stories however, allow you to describe a world to others that they can interpret in their head, and they can see by themselves how it would benefit them, and the ones around them. It’s an information passage mechanism that allows Humans to communicate and agree on a given concept, and they are everywhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Children’s bedtime stories - notice how several of these transmit moral values, this is, expectations of how one should behave in a given situation, in order to be in alignment with the overall group / society</li>
  <li>Novels, biographies, movies</li>
  <li>When interviewees tell you a story of their childhood, how they created their company, how they achieved X, what happened during their struggles, etc</li>
  <li>When a leader, such as a CEO, convinces others of their vision / story, and that future prospects that would derive from working in a certain direction</li>
  <li>When meeting someone, when you talk about your background and your goals</li>
  <li>When you sell you employee skills to an employers, giving a summary of your professional trajectory</li>
  <li>When politicians portray their vision on how they want to improve their nation</li>
  <li>The lore of a nation, tribe, family, and their laws / duties / rights</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="being-a-good-storyteller-is-a-powerful-skill">Being a good storyteller is a powerful skill</h3>

<p>As a species, one of our biggest distinguishing factors is that we are able to goal on highly abstract concepts that only exist in our minds, such as the concept of a company, a nation, a mission, an ideology, an intellectual relationship, the concept of money. As Yuval puts it, <em>“We are the only species with the ability to use language—not just to describe things we can see, taste, and touch, but also to invent stories about things that don’t exist.”</em></p>

<p>A magical thing happens when a group of people interpret and value that concept in the same way, and are highly aligned on it. Narrative is the first and most crucial step for leaders who want to solve big problems and shape the world for the better. After all, a person can have the greatest idea in the world, but if they fail to rally others to make that idea come alive, nothing gets done.</p>

    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/04/01/banishing_mobile_phones_from_bedroom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-problem--why">The Problem / Why</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://youtu.be/K2tGt2XWd9Q?si=h-xh-X90JWxwF1KU&amp;t=2229">asked</a> about which practices supported Chris Williamson into his current position, Chris mentioned that sleeping with his phone outside of the bedroom and getting a plain alarm clock was his number one change.</p>

<p>I found that statement interesting, especially because I had grown a habit of seeing the occasional video before sleep and being engaged with random distractions shortly after waking up.</p>

<p>Overriding these behaviors required a good amount of self discipline and willpower to be overridden, and fundamentally deviated my focus from what I would want to accomplish on a given day, from the book I had been putting off, or to simply wind down.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-alarm-and-note-taking">Alternative Alarm and Note Taking</h2>

<p>Even though my phone sponsored my distractions, it was also my trusty alarm and favorite way to write down notes and reflections that crossed my mind outside my work desk. So to make the leap of keeping my mobile phone at the bedroom door, I would need to replace the alarm clock, and find a new way to write down my notes.</p>

<h3 id="alarm">Alarm</h3>

<p>This seems like an easy step, but it turns out the selection of alarms is immense, and many of them either do too much, or don’t tick all the boxes.</p>

<p>Essentially, I needed a trustworthy, low maintenance, alarm with essential functionalities that would not flood my dark bedroom with blue light when I wanted to check the time during night.</p>

<p>I essentially browsed through:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.lumie.com/">Lumie alarms</a>: had the enticing proposition of science-backed approach of waking up via warm light or soothing sounds, but didn’t have the basic functionality of having recurrent alarms on the models I was interested in, and required a mains connection, meaning that upon a power outage it could only support itself for a limited amount of time.</li>
  <li>White brand alarm clocks: the selection is immense on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=alarm+clock">Amazon</a>, and even though they come in at relatively cheap prices, some require a mains connection, or have short battery life, or need to be recharged every so often, or do too much (like having a bluetooth connection) or use noisy clock dials.</li>
</ul>

<p>After several searches, I’ve stumbled upon Braun alarm clocks. These have been around for decades, and I recalled that Steve Jobs was inspired more than once by products made by Braun when creating his Apple products, due to Braun’s thoughtful approach on how everyday products were designed.</p>

<p>I’ve settled with the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Braun-Digital-Compact-Negative-Crescendo/dp/B083KMCHRH">Braun BC08B</a>. No moving parts, a single AAA battery apparently lasts more than half a year, small, simple, easy to operate, and the beeping sound is not brain drilling. The one aspect I am not fully satisfied is its screen light, which when activated is too strong on a dark bedroom (my mobile phone far excels in this aspect, due to its less intrusive always on black and white display).</p>

           </picture>
         </center>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="note-taking">Note Taking</h3>

<p>These were the alternatives I found for writing down notes, and jotting down diagrams (as a plus):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Notebook:
    <ul>
      <li>Pros: Easy to use, low cost, no distractions, low maintenance (no battery to recharge, software updates, etc)</li>
      <li>Cons: My handwriting is appalling and my character output is much lower when compared to typing; extra step needed to transfer it a digital means; harder to organize</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>E-Ink Devices:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://remarkable.com/">Remarkable 2</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: well thought out, clean and focus driven, great writing experience; allows for handwriting to text conversion</li>
          <li>Cons: Able to connect to a Google Drive for free, but works storage rather than syncing, so it is cumbersome to iterate on notes and diagrams between it and other devices</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://supernote.com/">Supernote</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: clean and focus driven, great writing experience; allows for handwriting to text conversion; open <a href="https://trello.com/b/l0COP24j/supernote-a5-x-a6-x-nomad-software-roadmap-2024">roadmap</a> and ideology; easy repair and upgrade</li>
          <li>Cons: As with Remarkable, it does not provide real file syncing, but file copy to Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B">Kindle Scribe</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: Writing experience seems to be good and on-device handwriting recognition to convert notes into actual text</li>
          <li>Cons: No Google Play apps, meaning that Google Keep and Google Docs would not be available, and no Google Drive sync; the device caters more to readers, rather than writers in my opinion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air3-ePaper/dp/B0CP3CGG8P">Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Pros: it can use Google Keep and Google Docs apps, since can do almost everything a normal Android table can, but since it uses a e-ink screen and has limited processing capabilities, it does not make a good fit for browsing the web or seeing videos (which is actually a good thing); the default experience and drawing app are bloated offer too many distractions (<a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/03/25/minimalist_boox.html">see here how to debloat it</a>); allows for handwriting to text conversion within Onyx drawing app</li>
          <li>Cons: noticeable lag when writing; if not using Onyx’s cloud, it requires extra steps to export and share a diagram / drawing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>: even though this device is amazing, it made it too easy to access the same distractions I was trying to avoid, and it also sports an invasive backlit screen that provides too much stimulus while in bed. A hard no.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the options above, I picked the Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W. Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air-ePaper-Dark-grey-green/dp/B0CHF423CP">color screen version of this tablet</a> is available, but I did not pick it because of Air C’s reduced battery life from the always-on BSR (Boox Super Refresh Technology). BSR allows for a smoother and more responsive experience when writing for example, but that is not actually a problem since I mainly use the Boox to write long streams of text / braindumps, rather than text editing; and BSR also takes it a step closer to a general purpose tablet non-eink display, which starts to defeat the initial purpose. Apart from that, I have a personal preference towards the black and white screen feel.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>

<p>I have now transitioned to not having any mobile phones in my bedroom, and only having the Boox Air 3, the Braun alarm clock, physical books and my Kindle. I am pretty satisfied with this change, which I’ve noticed to provide more focus time after waking up, more time to think, plan my day, reflect, write my thoughts, read, and wind down.</p>

<p>The most fundamental aspect was having more time to focus on my plan for the day, which translated into a substantial improvement on how productive and consequential my days have become. I welcome anyone to give it a try!</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/03/25/minimalist_boox.html"/>
    <updated>2024-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/03/25/minimalist_boox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/04/01/banishing_mobile_phones_from_bedroom.html">plan to banish mobile phones with access to instant rewards from my bedroom</a>, I’ve acquired a Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W, which is a Android tablet with a black and white e-ink screen that is focused on writing and reading <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="house-rules">House Rules</h2>

<p>First of all, <em>why</em> I did get the device in the first place? This was in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce distractions before going to sleep and after waking up, increase focus on the things that really mattered, block out all other noise, and make it really hard to have access to instant gratification and rewards (such as video consumption)</li>
  <li>Register any ideas and thoughts that occur to me before and after going to sleep, which is one of my most proficuous times for such, and then have them available on other devices</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How</em> to achieve this using the BOOX:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only two functionalities should be easy and quick to use:
    <ul>
      <li>Write text and notes (via Google Keep and Google Docs)</li>
      <li>Write diagrams and mental maps (via the device’s main app, which has the snappiest performance)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Getting to above functionalities should be as fast as possible, and they should be fast</li>
  <li>The cost to get to other apps and functionalities should be high</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="focusing--debloating">Focusing &amp; Debloating</h2>

<p>The Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W is not an incredibly fast device, and comes with several functionalities, apps, and a launcher that increase the distraction degree, and also slow down the device.</p>

<h3 id="google-play-google-keep--docs">Google Play, Google Keep &amp; Docs</h3>

<p>The first step towards the objective above was to install Google Play (see <a href="https://help.boox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8569260963732-Google-Play-Store">guide here</a>, and afterwards installed these apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Keep</li>
  <li>Google Docs</li>
  <li>Android Hidden Settings - this app provides access to several hidden settings, that allow the access of settings such as enabling the Developer Options in Android (useful in the debloating process described below)</li>
  <li>Lawnchair (see below)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-launcher-lawnchair">New Launcher: Lawnchair</h3>

 <p class="media-caption media-caption-two"><b>After:</b> Using Lawnchair Launcher<br class="video-br-end" /></p>
</div>
</center>

<p>The default device’s launcher was replaced by <a href="https://lawnchair.app/">Lawnchair</a>, which is a lightweight, open-source, highly customizable launcher for Android.</p>

<p>What was added to the Lawnchair’s home screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Keep</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Docs</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Onyx Launcher - for any custom changes that are only accessible on the device’s default launcher, which are are in practice, so this was eventually something I removed from the home screen as I wrote this note</li>
  <li>Shortcut to Google Calendar - to add any events or reminders</li>
  <li>A widget to Onyx Sketch app, which is one the only way I found to have that app directly accessible from the Lawnchair home screen, without having to use Onyx’s launcher to do so. The widget can be added by long pressing on the home screen, then select “Widgets”, and then on the “ContentBrowser” section select one of the “Notes” widgets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disabling-bloatware">Disabling bloatware</h3>

<p>With all of the above in place, we could start disabling non-essential apps and services, to prevent them from running in the background.</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step is to enable “Developer Options”, by accessing the system settings via the “Android Hidden Settings” app above, and then finding the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options">Build Number</a> in order to click it enough times to eventually enable “Developer Options”.</li>
  <li>Connect the BOOX to the computer</li>
  <li>On the computer’s terminal run the below commands</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, these are the commands one can run via the terminal to manage bloat apps:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>// See all packages
$ adb shell pm list packages

// See all disabled packages
$ adb shell pm list packages -d

// Disable a package
$ adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 &lt;package_to_disable&gt;

// Re-enable a package
$ adb shell pm enable &lt;package_to_disable&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br />
And these are the specific ones I used in my BOOX to disable bloatware, without any relevant side effects for my usages:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.appmarket
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.floatingbutton
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.dict
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.mail
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.igetshop
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.easytransfer
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.kime
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.android.ksync
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.onyx.calculator
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The commands above should be enough to remove all bloatware, and if you wish to learn more, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/how-to-disable-and-remove-android-bloatware/26993/">this article</a> and <a href="https://digitaluncoded.com/cpu-usage-android">this article</a> provide a good overview.</p>

<h2 id="using-an-external-keyboard">Using an external keyboard</h2>

<p>Given that this device is meant to be used in bed, and since it is quite unwieldy to write on the on-screen display, I was looking for an external keyboard that could be somehow attached to the BOOX, that would bestable, low-maintenance and allowed for flexibility on the writing position.</p>

<p>From the keyboards and keyboard stands I’ve researched, the most elegant solution I found was to use <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/keyboards/k480-multi-device-wireless.html">Logitech K480</a>, a bluetooth keyboard with an in-built cradle, detachable batteries (i.e. zero issues related internal battery becoming faulty), incredible battery span (some users reported this to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoH2bXoNEE0">in the order of years</a>), and wonderful typing experience.</p>

<p>One caveat is that the BOOX slides backward and falls when using the cradle without any other aid. A very simple fix is to get a piece of cardboard, and place it behind the BOOX (see picture below) to create a better fit. It works remarkably well.</p>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="BOOX attached to Logitech K480 cradle, with and added piece of cardboard">

           </picture>
         </center>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="writing-and-drawing">Writing and Drawing</h2>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>Writing is my main use case for the device, and even though it has some lag when doing it, it works great for me, because I tend to write long streams of ranting text, rather than editing it.</p>

<div>
	<div class="youtube-player" data-id="bYENTrabzXw" data-thumbsize="1"></div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The best mode I’ve found for writing was the “A2” Mode. It has ghosting, but is responsive enough for this use case.</p>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="BOOX attached to Logitech K480 cradle, with and added piece of cardboard">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/minimalist_boox/configuration_for_writing.webp" aria-label="BOOX attached to Logitech K480 cradle, with and added piece of cardboard" />
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/minimalist_boox/configuration_for_writing.png" aria-label="BOOX attached to Logitech K480 cradle, with and added piece of cardboard" />
             <img src="https://lopespm.com/files/minimalist_boox/configuration_for_writing.png" aria-label="BOOX attached to Logitech K480 cradle, with and added piece of cardboard" />
           </picture>
         </center>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="drawing">Drawing</h3>

<p>To draw, I use the default Onyx’s Sketch app due to its responsiveness, even though I would have preferred to have a more customizable UI interface and faster ways to share the drawing.</p>

<p>Sharing is one of the downsides of the Onyx Sketch app. You need to either use their cloud service, or export the image in order to get the sketch easily accessible on other devices. I’ve opted to use the export functionality, which allows to directly share the image to a Google Keep note, which fits well into my workflow. I would prefer to not have this extra step, but still, it works well enough.</p>

<div>
	<div class="youtube-player" data-id="iW3IZ9MnFL8" data-thumbsize="1"></div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>This has been one of the most satisfying devices I’ve added to my routines, and it’s incredibly satisfying to write on this device, almost distraction free. It allows enough customizability for it to be tailored to my use case, but is also limited enough to deter me from falling prey to distractions.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful towards your journey - do let me know your tips for distraction free environments!</p>

    <updated>2024-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/02/18/elon_musk_biography</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been hearing the <a href="https://amzn.to/3I97bBi">latest Elon Musk biography</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on audiobook, and just like Ashlee Vance’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3I5hUNu">book</a><sup>1</sup>, I’m finding it incredibly interesting. Here’s why:</p>

<h2 id="possibilities-monty-python-costs-whys-and-whos">Possibilities, Monty Python, costs, whys and whos</h2>

<h3 id="the-action-on-potential">The action on potential</h3>

<p>I find his path inspiring. It makes me want to create and do things, and shows that many things that are thought to be impossible, are actually achievable. There is a whole realm of opportunities waiting to be grabbed, and his life demonstrates just that.</p>

<p>There is a cost though. If it were that easy, everyone would do it.</p>

<h3 id="the-defining-characteristics">The defining characteristics</h3>

<p>The book goes deeper into the unique aspects that allow Musk to be an extreme overachiever, but also the personal and professional costs those same aspects inflict.</p>

<p>Musk’s capacity to take pain, risk, stress and adversity is staggering. I’ve been reading several biographies over the past years and met quite a few people throughout my life. I can only find a handful of them that are even comparable.</p>

<p>The relentless pursuit, sometimes maniacal, of product quality, functional and non-wasteful design, and effective manufacturing. All in the name of a greater objective, larger than any single human being or corporation.</p>

<h3 id="the-relationships">The relationships</h3>

<p>The book dives into the relationships that shaped Musk (for the better, for the worse, or both), the types of relationships he consistently attracted (which resonated with his personality and upbringing), and essential relationships that allowed him and his projects to thrive.</p>

<p>They come to further prove that no man or woman is an island. You can’t succeed by your own.</p>

<h3 id="the-humor">The humor</h3>

<p>Consistently throughout Musk’s life, there is a balance between dark and light, between lighthearted comedy and downright hell.</p>

<p>I’ve had a good laugh with some of the humorous sides though, such as when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grA5XmBRC6g">eels and hovercrafts</a> were catered to one of his marriages, or when Blue Origin filed a formal protest against SpaceX to prevent the company from having exclusive use of a NASA launchpad, to which Musk <a href="https://spacenews.com/37389musk-calls-out-blue-origin-ula-for-phony-blocking-tactic-on-shuttle-pad/">replied</a> that <em>“if they do somehow show up in the next  5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs. Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.”</em></p>

<p>Shortly after, a SpaceX employee bought dozens of inflatable unicorns and took a picture of them standing in a flame duct 🦄</p>

<h2 id="musks-algorithm">Musk’s algorithm</h2>

<p><em>“The Algorithm”</em>, is a distillation of lessons learned while relentlessly increasing production capacity, which Musk repeatedly preached on his enterprises:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Question every requirement</li>
  <li>Delete any part of the process you can</li>
  <li>Simplify and optimize</li>
  <li>Accelerate cycle time</li>
  <li>Automate</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="questioning-requirements">1. Questioning requirements</h3>

<p>It can be summarized into this: <em>“The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.”</em>. It’s a recurrent theme.</p>

<p>Doesn’t come without a cost though: it is often associated with conflict and chaos.</p>

<h3 id="about-2-delete-any-part-of-the-process-you-can">About 2. Delete any part of the process you can</h3>

<p><em>“Delete, delete, delete”</em></p>

<p>Optimization many times goes hand in hand with deletion. Deleting is hard. It requires letting go of past achievements, comfort, and acceptance that something is not coming back. Almost like a breakup.</p>

<h3 id="simplify-and-optimize">3. Simplify and optimize</h3>

<p>Goes hand in hand with deletion.</p>

<h3 id="accelerate-cycle-time">4. Accelerate cycle time</h3>

<p>This is where intensity and being “hard core” are most leveraged, in my view. Again, with their pros and cons.</p>

<h3 id="automate">5. Automate</h3>

<p>A more obvious one. Put a machine to do it. Easier said than done though.</p>

<h2 id="data-points---cause--effect-probabilities">Data points -&gt; cause &amp; effect probabilities</h2>

<p>I’m fond of biographies because they provide several data points that I can later use in my life. This is, which set of actions preceded a given consequence. Of course the context matters, and surely no same action will lead to the same consequence, specially if made by different people.</p>

<p>But patterns start to emerge, and their respective probabilities. These help me solidify my own personal theories and strategies. Learning from others is important. It allows for “shortcuts” similar to the ones provided by good mentors.</p>

<p>To build these, I need data points, a lot of them.</p>

<p>That is why I like Isaacson’s biographies so much <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This is this third book I read (or hear) from Walter Isaacson, and one of the things I enjoy most about his writing is how deep he goes into the details of someone’s story. I believe that details are important when portraying someone’s life. Sometimes, the smallest of events make an immense difference over someone’s path.</p>

<h2 id="just-read--hear-it">Just read / hear it</h2>

<p>Love him, or hate him, I recommend Musk’s biography to just about anyone.</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/01/27/project_planning_framework.html"/>
    <updated>2024-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2024/01/27/project_planning_framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Different goals require different roadmapping and planning techniques.</p>

<p>In this post, a simple framework is proposed to classify a goal using three axes, in order to inform the approach taken towards reaching that goal. The three axes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: how much leeway is there to extend the deadline to deliver a goal?</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: how many steps are needed to reach the goal?</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: how sure are we that a given step will move us toward the goal?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-of-how-to-apply-the-framework">Example of how to apply the Framework</h2>

<h3 id="scenario-1-reach-compliance">Scenario 1: Reach Compliance</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>An external entity (let’s say, government or partner company), has made a set of requirements for which your team must provide compliance for on a fixed, non-negotiable timeline, with limited team capacity. The “definition of done” is well defined by this entity, and there is a low amount of unknowns of how to reach the goals.</p>

<h4 id="axes">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: High</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: Low</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>

<p>This goal has sensitive timelines and is archetypal top-down. The deadline will be reached in one way or the other, so all hands are needed on deck to tackle this goal. In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a Gant-style chart, where there is a heavy emphasis on the timeline</li>
  <li>Apply stricter project management, more process driven</li>
</ul>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/compliance.webp" aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance" />
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/compliance.png" aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance" />
             <img src="https://lopespm.com/files/project_planning_framework/compliance.png" aria-label="Project planning diagram for reaching compliance" />
           </picture>
         </center>

<h3 id="scenario-2-increase-effectiveness-of-a-user-flow">Scenario 2: Increase Effectiveness of a User Flow</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement-1">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>Your team supports a user flow, such as a check-out flow, for which the goal is the increase the conversion amount by <em>X</em>. There are known levers you have available to drive this metric, but also many others which are unbeknownst and would need experimentation and research. This increase is not business critical, so there is an underlying lenience in case the goal is not hit.</p>

<h4 id="axes-1">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: High</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach-1">Approach</h4>

<p>Unlike Scenario 1, which is exploitation heavy, this scenario favors an approach which is exploration heavy, due to the high amount of uncertainty of which projects will be able to move the needle towards the successful completion of the goal. To de-risk and address this goal, a high level of adaptability will be needed, and several opportunities will need to be created to discover which levers can be used. In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have open ended brainstorming sessions</li>
  <li>Leverage user research and focus groups</li>
  <li>Apply looser project management, to allow for quick and less trashier pivots</li>
</ul>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Project planning diagram for increasing effectiveness">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/effectiveness.webp" aria-label="Project planning diagram for increasing effectiveness" />

             <img src="https://lopespm.com/files/project_planning_framework/effectiveness.png" aria-label="Project planning diagram for increasing effectiveness" />
           </picture>
         </center>

<h3 id="scenario-3-unification-of-several-systems-into-one">Scenario 3: Unification of Several Systems into One</h3>

<h4 id="goaling-statement-2">Goaling Statement</h4>

<p>Your team is tasked to unify several internal systems into a single one, where several dependencies between different projects exist, and the time each project will take ranges from certain to unknown.</p>

<h4 id="axes-2">Axes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline sensitivity</strong>: Low</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency level between goals / projects</strong>: High</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty of which steps will drive the goal forward</strong>: Low / Medium</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="approach-2">Approach</h4>

<p>The focus here should be on making clear which are the dependencies between different projects, and allow some leniency towards the completion of each of the projects, while actively managing the team’s capacity to focus on the projects which are discovered to require a heavier lift. In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a full dependency graph, allowing for each of the projects timelines to have some leeway where needed</li>
  <li>Incentivize structured system design documents and discussions, making sure that all involved parties are aligned on a given approach, and engineers are able to explain not only the system they own, but also other systems involved in their unification</li>
</ul>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Project planning diagram for unification of systems">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/project_planning_framework/unification.webp" aria-label="Project planning diagram for unification of systems" />

           </picture>
         </center>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>The framework above is quite simple and could potentially be used for several other different use cases. It might also be missing some essential parameters that are relevant for your specific context. Let me know if you find these, I would be happy to review the framework accordingly. Regardless, hope the above can be useful on your next roadmapping / planning cycle!</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/12/31/meme-transcending-host.html"/>
    <updated>2023-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/12/31/meme-transcending-host</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is an ephemeral nature to everything. That includes me, you and this blog. This blog is currently <a href="https://github.com/lopespm/lopespm.github.com">hosted in GitHub</a>, and nothing guarantees that after I’m long gone, or even before, GitHub might cease to exist. How to account for that?</p>

<p>One way to keep these writings alive, would be to assign a third person with the task of keeping this establishment online. What happens when that person is gone though? It’s turtles all the way down.</p>

<p>Another way would be to find a self sustainable digital mechanism to keep this blog alive, ie, a bot. That has its own issues as well, since technologies change and distributed systems like <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> come and go.</p>

<p>The other option to extend the lifespan of these digital contents is to have these writings persisted into a physical medium. A book. No maintenance required. As long as it can be kept safe from unfortunate <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning">book burning events</a>, the probability that a single copy remains alive, and can be made accessible (such as a public library) to someone and hopefully improve their life, increases.</p>

<h2 id="no-input-no-output">No Input, No Output</h2>

<p>The jump from a humble blog to a book is quite a leap. Outrageous even. Perhaps doable.</p>

<p>Some of the books I’ve recently read gave me some guidance and ideas on how to take that germinal idea into fruition (<em>note that the following links are affiliate links, and as an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases whose commissions help this small establishment, <u>at no additional cost to you</u></em>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rolf Dobelli’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3NJ12is">The Art of the Good Life</a> is a collection of 52 articles that Dobelli wrote for a newspaper column.</li>
  <li>Dobelli also previously wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/3NGItvC">The Art of Thinking Clearly</a> (I did not read this one), which reveals the most common errors of judgment, and how to avoid them, throughout 99 short chapters. Although the idea the idea of 99 chapters seems to have been <a href="https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/dobelli.htm">original to Nassim Taleb’s</a> project to publish “99 (convex) heuristics”</li>
  <li>Steven Bartlett shares on his <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbDNas">Diary of a CEO book</a> that at 21 years old, he made a promise to himself that every day at 7PM, he would write a tweet or make a video delivering a single idea, and then post it online at 8PM, which Steven claims to have been the habit the most difference to advance his knowledge and skills. It completely changed his life trajectory, and consequently it’s the piece of advice Steven most strongly urges for anyone looking to be a better thinker, speaker, writer, or content creator. The key here was that he made it a daily obligation, not just an interest.
    <ul>
      <li>From this, I assume that this habit was foundational to his <a href="https://stevenbartlett.com/the-diary-of-a-ceo-podcast/">Diary of a CEO podcast</a>, which eventually resulted in the book above</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After listening to <a href="https://amzn.to/3GYxlq6">Benjamin Franklin’s biography</a> on audiobook, I’ve came to learn that not only was Franklin a statesman, diplomat, scientist and inventor, but also a prolific writer, printer and publisher, which were unbeknownst to me. As a publisher, Benjamin Franklin wrote several dissertations and essays <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (such as the ones under the pen name of Silence Dogood), which I’m sure to have fed into Franklin’s books, which brought many interesting ideas to a large population, like his own <a href="https://amzn.to/4aG58ly">autobiography</a>, which could be seen as a compilation of several of his ideas and reflections / writings (these go hand in hand).</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from finding the above points inspirational, they also make me think that creating a discipline where I consistently share my reflections and experiences via writing or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VHNCq3yGJrLn82VsdONOg">videos</a>, not only helps me <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking.html">solidify my thoughts</a> and provides more immediate feedback on how valuable these are to its viewers / readers (which allows me to course correct and iterate <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>), but also provides the building blocks to put together a hopefully meaningful and concise book to help surpass the limited lifespan of the digital medium that hosts this blog and my YouTube videos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No Input, No Output</p>

  <p><em>― Joe Strummer, lead singer of The Clash</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-path-towards-physical-persistence">The Path Towards Physical Persistence</h2>

<p>Given the above, here are some action points to put the wheels in motion towards building “physical persistence” via a book, and give better chances for its memes to transcend their host <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My low priority 2024 <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html">goal</a> is continuing to publish blog notes and videos. The numeric goal I’ve set for myself is to publish 12 blog notes, about once per month. From these, make the respective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VHNCq3yGJrLn82VsdONOg">YouTube videos</a>, but this would be a stretch sub-goal (albeit, one that I really enjoy)
    <ul>
      <li>This was a consequence of my recent “personal performance” review for this year’s personal goals, which was a good opportunity to reflect on what went well, what went less well, what was achieved, and what was missed. One of the aspects that I aim to implement for the <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want.html">upcoming year’s goals</a> is to use numeric goals, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once 50 or 99 meaningful blog notes are written, attempt to compile them into a book.
    <ul>
      <li>Why 50 or 99? Upon reaching 50 notes, I might feel that not enough substantial content was generated to be distilled into a book. Once 99 notes are reached however, it would be more certain that enough meaningful content was accumulated (hopefully). I would expect the distillation process to remove several notes that would be deemed to have less quality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Looking forward to 2024! 🎉</p>

</div>

<p>I was recently in NYC. It was one of the most interesting experiences I’ve ever had.</p>

<p>Each one has their own perspectives when visiting the city, and I’ve asked several people about theirs before the trip, which helped immensely when planning out my itinerary. Now it’s my time to pay it forward. Here is my guide / personal perspective of New York.</p>

<h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>

<p>Having a pre-curated list of points of interest on Google Maps was one of the most useful and time efficient aspects of the entire trip. This allowed me to quickly improvise and make the most of my surroundings, since I could just look at the map to check which nearby places I could visit at any given time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/e6z91pon4Lco8r6F8">Points of Interest Map</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/swXwxeps7uAJWcno9">Restaurants Map</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall" style="background-image: url('/files/nyc/pmap.png')"></div>
</div>

<h2 id="museums">Museums</h2>

<p>I didn’t consider myself to be an excessive photographer. I’ve discovered on this trip that I was probably wrong. I can’t recall the last time I took so many photos, it was like I was in an outstanding candy store of visual goodies.</p>

<h3 id="intrepid-museum">Intrepid Museum</h3>

<p>Let’s start with fashion. I’ve been pointed out that my glasses make me look nerdy / square / too serious / too much like an engineer. Well, thanks to this museum piece, I can now say they were developed for space walks:</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide" style="background-image: url('/files/nyc/pPXL_20231210_162525852_2.jpg')"></div>
</div>

<p>Oh, and look back and you will also see the Space Shuttle <em>Enterprise</em>, the first orbiter of the Space Shuttle system:</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide" style="background-image: url('/files/nyc/pPXL_20231210_161516492_2.jpg')"></div>

  <div class="image-mosaic-card" style="background-image: url('/files/nyc/pPXL_20231210_162348213_2.jpg')"></div>
</div>

<p>You can find these glasses, the space shuttle, sit inside the Mercury capsule or A-6 Intruder cockpit, see real life jet planes like the Lockheed A-12, in the Intrepid museum.</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide" style="background-image: url('/files/nyc/pPXL_20231210_160040171_2.jpg')"></div>

</div>

<p>Where is the Intrepid museum? The museum is an World War II–era aircraft carrier. Yes, the vessel <em>is</em> the museum. You can explore several of it’s interior sections, including the bridge, living quarters, gun and bomb bays, go through the same narrow escalator that pilots took to the flight deck, all of these throughout several floors and different explorable rooms</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">
  <div class="image-mosaic-card image-mosaic-card-tall image-mosaic-card-wide" style="background-image: url('/files/nyc/pPXL_20231210_154908796_2.jpg')"></div>

</div>

<p>Right beside the Intrepid lies USS Growler, a diesel powered submarine retrofitted to deliver Regulus nuclear missiles, as a form of nuclear deterrence during Cold War. You can go inside the submarine and get an intimate experience of how it’s lived throughout their 2 month patrols, where they faced the constant scenario of being called upon to launch a nuclear missile onto Russian soil, destroying not only their target, but most likely kill themselves on the process, since the process to launching / reloading Regulus missiles was long and would expose this submarine to enemy reconnaissance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since it was a diesel submarine, it required to be at surface or near surface level (it was not possible to push out their exhaust gasses when deep in the ocean) to enable a set of its 3 engines to charge its on-board batteries that would power the submarine and its electric motors.</li>
  <li>It also needed to be periodically refueled, so the submarine ran a long circular patrol in the Pacific Ocean to refuel to eventually sit near Russian enemy lines for dozens of days.</li>
  <li>The crew had to maintain absolute secrecy about their mission, and none of their partners knew the context of it</li>
  <li>The families of the crew members knew nothing about their mission, and that if they did launch a nuclear missile, they would be exposed, and most likely be killed as they expose themselves to launch the nuclear load (not to mention the annihilation that comes from the nuclear warhead)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found the underlying story and details of this submarine and this mission to be so interesting, that right after the tour, I went immediately in search of staff members to ask a series of questions that came about during the visit. They very kindly and patiently took the time to answer them, and one of the ladies even asked me if I was an engineer. I’m not sure what gave that away.

<h3 id="met">MET</h3>

<p>MET, or Metropolitan Museum of Art, has two locations: the museum in Fifth Avenue is the most famous one and is often referred to when mentioning MET. The other lesser known branch is in Upper Manhattan, the MET Cloisters.</p>

<h4 id="met-fifth-avenue">MET: Fifth Avenue</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you like the British Museum, you will love MET on Fifth Avenue</li>
  <li>They reconstructed the 10 BCE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Dendur">Temple of Dendur</a> Roman Egyptian religious structure, which was originally located in Tuzis (later Dendur). Must I say more?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>This massive museum spans through classical antiquity and ancient Egypt; paintings and sculptures from nearly all the European masters; and an extensive collection of American and modern art. All of these are intertwined with large thematic rooms where the installations are beautiful to behold. If you are going to see a single museum in New York, this should be the one.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the last books I’ve listen on audiobook was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-American-Walter-Isaacson/dp/074325807X">Walter Isaacson’s Benjamin Franklin biography</a>, where one of passages goes through the story of how a Duplessis’ painting of Franklyn’s portrait came to be. This <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436236?pkgids=367&amp;pos=1&amp;nextInternalLocale=en&amp;ft=*&amp;oid=436236&amp;rpp=4&amp;exhibitionId=%7Bfc6dc1eb-bea2-4986-afc2-1cd8b02db3ee%7D&amp;pg=1">1778 painting can be seen in the museum</a>, and curiously enough, Franklyn’s depiction on <a href="https://www.uscurrency.gov/denominations/100"><span>$</span>100 bills from 1914 to 1990</a> had him wearing a fur coat, just like this painting.</p>

<h4 id="met-cloisters">MET: Cloisters</h4>

<p>With the same ticket, one can visit the Cloisters and the 5th Avenue museum on the same day. The Cloisters museum is America’s only museum dedicated exclusively to the art and architecture of the Middle Ages, and is smaller than the 5th Avenue one. Still there much to explore not only inside the museum, but also on its surroundings</p>

<div class="image-mosaic">

<h3 id="national-history-museum">National History Museum</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I lost count of the amount of dinosaur skeletons I’ve seen in the natural history museum. And nothing quite prepares you to see a gigantic skeleton of a Titanosaur. It’s so big that its head extends outside of its new home in the Museum’s fourth-floor gallery.</li>
  <li>I’ve learned while browsing the museum about mass dinosaur graves and their relationship to draughts, and went through thought provoking sections, such as the presentation of a massive turtle specimen, that if it were to be extinct it would probably be right part of our imaginary and event movies.</li>
</ul>

<div class="image-mosaic">

<p>Another thought that stuck to me is how deeply connected we are to other animals, Earth and outer space. Seeing life sized representations of several of these makes them immediately more relatable.</p>

<h3 id="guggenheim">Guggenheim</h3>

<p>On Saturdays, from 5 to 8 pm, admission to the museum is “Pay What You Wish”, for a minimum of <span>$</span>1. I would recommend doing so, since the museum can be easily visited in less than one hour, and in my opinion, it’s more about the building than the pieces themselves</p>

<h3 id="broadway">Broadway</h3>

<p>Broadway shows are a hallmark of NYC, although if you are from London or Europe, I would recommend not seeing shows that are already available in London. For example, I’ve heard that Hamilton is better seen in London, due to the larger contextual part that King George has in the UK.</p>

<p>The Chicago musical is a good bet, and is the one I’ve attended to, it is the second longest-running show ever to run on Broadway, behind only The Phantom of the Opera</p>

<h3 id="comedy">Comedy</h3>

<p>Comedy Cellar is a comedy club in Manhattan where many top New York comedians perform, and where several comedians started, like Louis C.K. or Dave Chappelle. I found it be have down to earth, edgy comedy, and you are asked to leave your phone in a pouch, which I believe to increase presence of the entire crowd, but also provides extra freedom to comedians, given to how powerful cancel culture can be</p>

<h2 id="points-of-interest">Points of Interest</h2>

<h3 id="statue-of-liberty">Statue of Liberty</h3>

<p>You can get the Staten Island Ferry from the Whitehall terminal, for <em>free</em>. On your way to the terminal, several people will try to sell and cajole you into payed trips to the Statue of Liberty trips. The ferry is more than enough.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ferry runs <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/ferrybus/siferryschedule.shtml">every 30 minutes</a>, 24 hours per day, for most of the days, and travel time is approximately 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Once you get to Staten Island, you can either take some time to explore it, or just return immediately to Manhattan, by exiting the ferry, by entering St. George’s Ferry Terminal, and entering the boarding gates for the next ferry.</li>
  <li>When entering the Whitehall terminal, enter through the right side of the ferry in order to be on the same side that the Statue of Liberty will appear. If entering on St. George’s Ferry Terminal, enter through the left side of the ferry. Regardless, you can easily change sides when inside the ferry</li>
  <li>Most of the people will likely go to the top floor with larger windows, which will eventually get crowded. I recommend instead to take the bottom floor, and find a window that is already opened. The view is much clearer (since you don’t have a worn down piece of glass obfuscating the view), you can sit comfortably near the window, and you won’t need to fight a crowd (in principle)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="central-park">Central Park</h3>

<p>Central Park is an urban park between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City that was the first landscaped park in the United States. It is the sixth-largest park in the city, and it’s a great way to step out of the busyness of the city and discover the treasures that lie in the park.</p>

<p>Upon the southern end of the High Line park, you can view Little Island, and quickly walk to it. Little Island is an artificial island park, with some beautiful views and interesting layout</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the street itself, we can find the  New York Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in the world, which for decades filled the popular imagination with its hustle, bustle and hectic traders. Those same brokers and traders are now surrounded by computers that manage the majority of the buying and selling of stocks for their various accounts. Floor trading still exists, but it is responsible for a rapidly diminishing share of market activity.</li>
  <li>The Charging Bull of Wall Street is not really located on Wall Street itself, but it is quite near. The bull in finance represents optimism and growth. The statue on Wall Street represents the same ideas.</li>
  <li>The Federal Hall is a historic building, whose original building served as New York’s first City Hall and hosted the 1765 Stamp Act Congress before the American Revolution. With the establishment of the United States federal government in 1789, it was renamed Federal Hall, as it hosted the 1st Congress and was where George Washington was sworn in as the nation’s first president. The current structure was built as the U.S. Custom House for the Port of New York before serving as a Subtreasury building from 1862 to 1925, and the current national memorial commemorates the historic events that occurred at the previous structure.</li>

<h3 id="citigroup-center">Citigroup Center</h3>

<p>Due to material changes during construction, the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/z4F9FgXe4QfVZvux5">building</a> as initially completed was structurally unsound. To save money, Bethlehem Steel changed the plans in 1974 to use bolted joints, and wind loads were calculated from perpendicular winds, as required under the building code; in typical buildings, loads from quartering winds at the corners would be less.</p>

<p>In June 1978, after an inquiry from an engineering student, the structural engineer recalculated the wind loads on the building with quartering winds, and found these to significantly increase the load at the bolted joints, and that a wind capable of toppling Citicorp Center would occur every 55 years on average.</p>

<p>Starting in August 1978, construction crews covertly fixed the issue, and six weeks into the work, a major storm was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. The reinforcement was only half-finished, with New York City hours away from emergency evacuation. The storm eventually turned eastward and veered out to sea. The repairs were finished successfully, and no major issues happened ever since.</p>

<p>While the Brooklyn Bridge stands as the most famous bridge to cross the East River, you can easily dodge its flocking crowds by crossing the Williamsburg Bridge, which leads you into Williamsbridge, characterized by a contemporary art scene, hipster culture, and vibrant nightlife that has projected its image internationally as a “Little Berlin”</p>

<p>You can find several interesting places in Williamsburg such as the Domino Park, Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown Books and the City Reliquary Museum.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Brooklyn Museum is New York City’s second largest and contains an art collection with around 500,000 objects, and  is fairly easy to access from the subway. The breadth and depth of objects at the Brooklyn Museum is best compared to the Met, boasting strong departments of both Western and non-Western holdings. I didn’t fit enough time to visit the actual museum, but it is definitely on the todo list in case I visit the city again.</li>
  <li>Brooklyn’s Library four stories high main entrance is a marvel to behold just by itself</li>

<h3 id="where-to-eat">Where to Eat</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Unless you would be aiming to hit a specific high demand restaurant at a specific time span, there is limited need to pre-book a restaurant, since you can just walk for a few minutes and find other quality restaurants.</li>
  <li>There are several food stalls around NYC, many of which you will be able to recognize by their LED letterings and smell of burnt meat, I would personally avoid these. There are food stalls which are incredible though. One of these is <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/M9xwJBkt5n1bpkY87">Shawarma Bay</a>, just a block away from Radio City Music Hall. Incredible food, although it can gain quite a queue, which can take about 30 minutes, as it was my case. Worth the wait though– cops were eating there</li>
  <li>You can get incredibly good Deli Sandwiches in NYC, in places such as <a href="https://g.co/kgs/eXxHUA">Sunny &amp; Annie’s Deli</a>. I’ve personally tried one at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qKFMoUoXPdT9qSgg7">Gold Deli</a>, and it was seriously good.</li>
  <li>Are you in Times Square and want to grab a bite? Walk 2 blocks west and you will find yourself in Hell’s Kitchen, packed with good restaurants, without much less hassle</li>
  <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DDbPvmqBeturoA219">Wan Wan</a> Thai restaurant was the best dining experience I had in NYC, for an acceptable price.</li>

  <li>Williamsburg’s L’Industrie Pizzeria apparently has some of the best pizzas in NYC, but I can’t attest to that, given there was a massive queue when I arrived there. So I moved to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rosa's+Pizza/@40.7139722,-73.9582738,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c259438227569b:0x1ad684baf4902574!8m2!3d40.7139722!4d-73.9556935!16s%2Fg%2F11grts6bbq?entry=ttu">Rosa’s Pizza</a>, where I had delicious slice.</li>
  <li>On markets such as the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/5idADNssKsJFAe1aA">Chelsea Market</a> you can find several good food places.</li>

<h3 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This all depends on your budget, activities you would like to do, who is going with you, etc. But in general, I would advise on staying in Manhattan island, or at least near to a transport connection that can get you quickly to the city center, since it is where most of the points of interest are located, and transport links are quite good from there. Most likely you will also be in your lodging to sleep, and not much else.</li>
  <li>If looking for a hostel, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2EjoFJnZMMGqhC8N7">HI New York City Hostel</a> is a good one. It even sports free weekly comedy sessions every Sunday night. It’s located near Central Park, and you can’t go wrong with this one. In general, you can search through https://www.hostelworld.com/ and book through there, it was quite reliable for the two bookings I did.</li>
  <li>If looking for something more comfortable, citizenM Hotels are of incredible good value and location. Apart from the comfortable rooms that have nice view already, on Bowery it even has rooftop terrace with an amazing view of the city</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 id="money--how-to-pay">Money / How to Pay</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stores, food establishments (even chains), bodegas / delis, 7-11s, etc present their prices as pre-tax. New York City sales tax ranges from 4% to 8.875%, and <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/listings_of_taxable_and_exempt_food.htm">some products are exempt from it</a>.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to tip everywhere. On restaurants it is customary to tip 20%. There is some debate about whether you should calculate the tip on the amount before or after tax.</li>
  <li>You don’t really need cash. You do need it if you want to buy from street vendors, or if you want to dodge the additional cost that certain sellers impose on card transactions (like the shawarma above)  </li>
  <li>On restaurants and entertainment venues, it is common practice for the attendant to leave with the credit card, to later return with an attached invoice that is meant to be signed and filled with the tipping amount.
    <ul>
      <li>It also happened to me that when trying to pay by contactless card to a market vendor, the card kept being rejected, and since the card insertion feature was not available, the vendor wrote down the card number and details into the system to proceed with the payment. That failed as well, because the card got blocked by my bank due to a false-positive suspected fraud, as I later discovered. Eventually I just payed with cash to resolve the issue.</li>
      <li>As an European, the practice of being physically separated from the card, verification via signature, and freely writing down credit card numbers strike me as quite unsecure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="getting-around--transportation">Getting Around / Transportation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Walking is one of the best ways to discover the city. Sidewalks are broad, the city is grid shaped (so expect to be given coordinates in the form of street / avenue to pinpoint a place), and pedestrian lights and timings ran standard everywhere I visited. The large majority of my city exploration was made over the span of 180km, throughout 4 days. Extra tip: if you are used to barefoot shoes, wearing <a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/rw/">firm ground outsole Vivos</a> to do so is amazing. My feet were sore, but happy.</li>
  <li>Walking through the perpendicular numbered streets and avenues is an absolute bliss, and makes it quite easy to navigate through them. Several times I just looked at the map and quickly memorized something like “3 right, 2 left”, which translated to “cross 3 roads and turn right, and then cross 2 roads and turn left”. This would keep me walking going for a long time and have time to appreciate the surroundings, without the need to constantly check the map.</li>
  <li>Ferry boats are a great way to sight the city, for a low price (<span>$</span>4 for a one way-ticket), and you can buy these tickets through the NYC Ferry app or a ticket vending machine.</li>
  <li>Subway and Bus now have OMNI, which just means that you can tap in with your credit / debit card. Each ride costs <span>$</span>2.90, and there are no different prices for different zones. This has a [rolling 7 day price cap] (https://omny.info/fares), so you never pay more than <span>$</span>34 over that period.
    <ul>
      <li>Metro Card is the pre-paid version of this. If you need one, buy it directly from the machines to avoid being scammed. For example, a 7-Day Unlimited MetroCard costs <span>$</span>34 upfront, and can be used any number of times during those 7 days.
        <ul>
          <li>Be aware that if you swipe in, then get out from the station, and then attempt to shortly swipe in again, it will reject your swipe, due to being too recent. If that happens, ask a MTA attendant to let you in (if available), or do like many others and wait for someone to crack open the emergency exit from the inside. If you hear an alarm going off in the station, most likely it is because someone opened the emergency exit to let others in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Just like routine events such as figuring out post-tax prices purchases or how much and when to tip require some kind of mental effort, figuring out the different edge cases of the subway system will keep your mind busy. It is like there is a perpetual rat race game being played in the city.
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes trains stop at all stations, sometimes they don’t, sometimes trains have indicators of which station you are in, sometimes they don’t, sometimes the station has (non-standard) indications of how much time it takes for the next train to arrive, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes it rains heavily inside the stations, sometimes it doesn’t.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="other-notes">Other Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Something unexpected to me, which cannot be transmitted through visual media, is the collection of smells around New York, in almost all parts of the city, except a set of parks and neighborhoods mostly outside Manhattan. The smell of garbage (since it is comment that it accumulates in heaps of bags on city sidewalks), burnt street meat, horse manure in some parts of Central Park, a smell I can only describe as pervasive detergent / laundry smell that could even be detected inside several buildings like the MET and Delis; the strong smell of road paint (since it appears that several of the streets were recently repainted), and signature smells from the subway</li>
  <li>Several subway lines are relatively shallow, so they are easily heard at street level. They also generally run below the roads themselves, which I would assume to make it easier when building incredibly high skyscrapers whose foundations run quite deep.</li>
  <li>Be attentive of your surroundings and where you walk, such dodging through garbage debris and sidewalk cellar doors, be them open or <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2015/01/26/man-dies-falling-through-cellar-doors-in-brooklyn/">closed</a></li>
  <li>Be prepared to encounter people who are not as well off, and might be living in the streets. Use your judgment, keep out of confusions, be respectable and don’t engage with people who have serious mental issues. If you are in a rougher area, memorize your path when possible, and stop at a local shop if you need to get your bearings. Use your common sense</li>
  <li>You might have noticed that I didn’t mention the common Edge / Top of the Rock / Summit One / Empire State Building / etc observation decks. It’s not that I don’t enjoy incredible views, but it didn’t fall high enough on the list of priorities, specially because I’ve had the opportunity to see skyline views through other buildings I’ve passed by, such as the Hotel.</li>
  <li>I tend to like long trans-atlantic flights, since they provide a moment of low stimuli, where there is less incentive to use the internet. My personal piece of advice would be to avoid the usual in-flight entertainment. I love to use them to resume a book or to write down my reflections from a trip for example (several of article lines were written during the return flight)</li>
  <li>This only shows my ignorance, but I had no idea that so many well-known artists were originally from New York, like Jay-Z (Brooklyn), Cardi B (South Bronx), Spike Lee (Brooklyn), and of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RciKM866Rhk">Jenny from the block</a>. That explains why I’ve consecutively heard “Empire State of Mind”, from Jay-Z and Alicia Keys (Hell’s Kitchen), and “All I want for Christmas is You”, from Mariah Carey (raised in Huntington).</li>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Ever since I was a kid I had a considerable fascination with the USA. The culture that arrived through the small and big screens, the big companies and entrepreneurs that I admired, the language, the people I’ve met along the way, the stories. Having had the opportunity to visit and experience it first hand was a true privilege. I’ve lived it like it was my last time, and it imprinted in me several thoughts and perspectives that I’m sure to last a lifetime.</p>

<p>New York ain’t no DisneyLand, and Elmo’s pictures in Times Square don’t come for free either, so set expectations accordingly. It can be one of the most fulfilling experiences you’ll ever have. I advise you to come prepared and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Frank Sinatra sang that he wants “to wake up in the city that doesn’t sleep”. That phrase has a deep meaning that only struck me during my trip. The city does not indeed sleep. The Times Square lights, 24 hour subway, the constant movement. Living in NYC wakes you up, not only literally, but also figuratively. It wakes you up to a different reality that keeps you on your toes in several ways. In a way, it’s a celebration of life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Words are cheap and keep getting cheaper. The last notes on this blog could have been written via generative AI, and as time goes by, new generative models will likely create higher quality content than I could ever produce, consistently.</p>

<p>I didn’t use these because the <a href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking.html">writing process comes as a form of thinking</a>, but if there are automated mechanisms that increasingly outperform us humans in so many different areas, what does that leave us?</p>

<h2 id="human-connection">Human connection</h2>

<p>How comfortable would you be in having a relationship with a being that is orders of magnitude more intelligent and capable than you? Not just logical-mathematical intelligence, but emotional, linguistic, musical or even spatial intelligence.</p>

<p>A being so advanced that any form of communication or relationship between you and it would always be severely constrained, even with neural interfaces. A being so advanced that you would never be able to have an essential understanding of it. A being so advanced that you wouldn’t even know that you are being manipulated by it. How many humans do you know who are friends with chimpanzees or bonobos, our closest relatives?</p>

<p>We are still human beings, with all the perks and limitations that come with it.</p>

<p>I would claim that humans will always be attracted to their familiar counterparts. Other beings that share their own struggles and limitations, and by consequence, what they create and share. Machines have their important place in the world, and history has proven to us that life as whole improved as technology evolved to serve us, but it would be healthier for us to think of them as tools, rather than human replacements.</p>

<h2 id="bioengineered">Bioengineered</h2>

<p>We have been fitted with extraordinary senses and tools that allow us to efficiently interact with the world. It took milenea for nature to shape us, and as Leonardo da Vinci puts it when comparing natural to artificial structures: “Nature made the most perfect inventions. There is nothing superfluous, there is nothing lacking” (paraphrased)</p>

<h3 id="our-place">Our place</h3>

<p>Try having a machine fixing the leaky pipe in your bathroom, or to change your desk’s lightbulb. Odds are that you’ll be flooded and in the dark in the nearterm. There will come a point where they will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpraXaw7dyc">likely do that</a>, but we are still not there.</p>

<p>Machines / tools currently outperform us in several tasks on the digital realm, and in several heavy duty physical tasks. But when it comes to fine digital dexterity, human connection, and interaction with the real world and its complexities, we still have an edge.</p>

<h2 id="future-proofing">Future Proofing</h2>

<p>Take a look at the daily tasks in your job. How repetitive are they? If they are repetíve, how much of a human element is present? Look at your organization and see where rubber meets the road in terms of human connection and physical intervention.</p>

<p>Strive to be closer to that human interface and focus on delivering tangible value to people or businesses (group of people). With this simple mindset, I believe you’ll be in a safer place, surrounded with an abundant supply of meaningful (monetary, emotional, etc) value that you can extract and provide.</p>

    <updated>2023-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/10/21/investment_relative_cost_benefit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s say you spend <span>$</span>1,000 to acquire film equipment (camera, microphones, and lights) to shoot YouTube videos. If you use this equipment to film and publish 2 videos, it means that each of those videos costs <span>$</span>500 to produce. If 100 videos are published, each of them cost <span>$</span>10. If all of these videos are able to generate <span>$</span>10 of revenue, then the entire cost of the initial investment was amortized.</p>

<p>The above is a severely gross simplification<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the key point is that an investment left unused has a high associated cost. In the case above, if only two videos were to be produced, then it would have been a better idea to rent the equipment instead.</p>

<p>This simple heuristic of mapping the investment cost to its usage and upside, can be a potential rule of thumb in different scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="other-examples">Other Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apartment Rent</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You are renting an apartment for <span>$</span>1,000 per month. During the week you work in an office, on weekends you are sometimes out, and during the year you take sporadic vacations outside. Let’s say that, on average, you spend 14 hours per day on your apartment, including sleep → 14 hours * 30 days = 420 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that it costs costs about <span>$</span>33 per day to live in the apartment, or <span>$</span>2.3 per hour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Study → Work → Net Worth Gain</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You studied 30 hours per week for 3 years (30 hours per week * 52 weeks * 3 years = 4680 hours) to land a job that increases your net worth <span>$</span>10.000 every year (on average), for 30 years. A total of <span>$</span>300,000 of networth gains.</li>
      <li>This means that you will gain about <span>$</span>64 for each hour invested in studying, or $274 per day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Clothing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy pair of trousers for <span>$</span>50, and wear them twice per month throughout for 2 years (24 months * 2 times per month = 48 times these were used).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs about <span>$</span>1 to wear them each time.
        <ul>
          <li>By contrast, if these trousers were only used <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860620/fast-fashion-zara-hm-forever-21-boohoo-environment-cost">7 times</a>, it would cost about <span>$</span>7.14 to wear them each time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a Playstation 5 for <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console"><span>$</span>499.99</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/01/ps4_has_a_very_high_software_attach_rate_average_player_owns_around_ten_games">10 games</a> (<span>$</span>60 each) totalling <span>$</span>1.100. You play <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/ld7zuo/what_was_your_total_amount_of_hours_played_in_2020/">60 hours per year</a> during 5 years (60 hours * 5 years = 300 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that each playing hour costs about <span>$</span>3.6.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phone</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy an iPhone 15 Pro for <span>$</span>999, and use it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59952557">4.8 hours per day</a> during <a href="https://www.iphonelife.com/content/how-long-do-iphone-last-how-to-know-when-to-upgrade-your-iphone">2 years</a> (4.8 hours * 365 days * 2 years = 3504 hours).</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.29 per hour of active usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Computer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a MacBook Pro 13” for <span>$</span>$1299, and <a href="https://mediapeanut.com/how-long-should-a-macbook-pro-last/">use it</a> 3 times per week for 2.5 hours per session, throughout 7 years (3 times per week * 2.5 hours * 52 weeks per year * 7 years = 2730 hours)</li>
      <li>This means that it costs <span>$</span>0.48 per hour of usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Musical Instrument</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You buy a guitar for <span>$</span>100. You play the guitar once per week, for one hour, during 2 years. 52 weeks * 1 hour * 2 years = 104 hours.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour playing the guitar has a cost of <span>$</span>1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Video Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a standard Netflix subscription that costs <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926/us"><span>$</span>15.99 per month</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/advisor/vpn/netflix-statistics">3.2 hours</a> (3.2 hours * 30 days = 96 hours per month) of videos throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This mean that each hour costs about $0.17.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Audio Streaming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have a premium Spotify subscription that costs <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"><span>$</span>10.99 per month</a>, and listen to about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/813876/spotify-monthly-active-users-time-spent-listening/">25 hours</a> of music and podcasts throughout that month.</li>
      <li>This means that each hour costs about <span>$</span>0.44.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We could go on with further examples, as this simple heuristic could be applied to several scenarios, and the cost cost benefit analysis could have any perspective one so desires, but I would invite you to visit your storage and search for something you acquired long ago that got used less times than expected, and do a rough calculation of what was it’s relative cost / benefit.
The same for any other investment you did in the past.</p>

<p>Was it a surprising result?</p>

<p>How did it stack up against your initial expectations?</p>

    <link href="https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/09/30/goal_clarity_in_delegation.html"/>
    <updated>2023-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/09/30/goal_clarity_in_delegation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously, in <a href="https://lopespm.com/2022/03/22/learnings-software-engineer-techlead.html">“Learnings as a Software Engineer Techlead”</a>, I’ve alluded to the 75/25 rule, where if you are ~75% certain that someone will correctly execute a given project/task, then delegate. The other ~25% is the unknown space that the person needs in order to learn, explore, make errors, innovate and grow.</p>

<p>If the project/task was decided to be delegated, what comes next?</p>

<h2 id="clarity-of-goals">Clarity of Goals</h2>

<p>One common challenge I’ve confronted when delegating was how unpredictable and uncontrollable the results felt upon handing over the work. This unstructured approach often left me thinking how I could decrease the non-completion risk by diminishing the delegated scope, and created confusion on the delegatee side on how they could proceed.</p>

<p>One tidbit of information from the “Who not How” book provided the guidance and structure to unlock this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(…) research has found that teams who have high levels of autonomy but low clarity goals, as well as little performance feedback, perform worse than teams with low autonomy.</p>

  <p><em>― <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Not-How-Accelerating-Teamwork-ebook/dp/B0867ZJ151">Who not How, by Dan Sullivan with Dr. Benjamin Hardy</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is claimed in the above research that teams which have high autonomy, high goal clarity and regular feedback on their results, were observed to have their performance shooting through the roof.</p>

<p>Apart from regular feedback, goal clarity is incredibly important, and even though it might sound obvious, it can be overlooked and drowned out on the process of delegation.</p>

<h2 id="clarity-in-practice">Clarity, in Practice</h2>

<p>After the above realization, I’ve made it a priority for each piece of delegated work to clearly define what was expected as an outcome, its definition of done, important milestones and deadlines, when should an issue be scaled to me, and which are the ownerships for each of the participants.</p>

<p>All of the above communicated in a clear and concise way, and preferably publicly documented to increase accountability and decrease ambiguity (depending on the situation, merely communicating these verbally might be enough, especially if the task is simple).</p>

<h2 id="the-delegation-formula">The Delegation Formula</h2>

<p>Given the above, the proposed formula for delegation is:</p>

<p><em>Delegation = [ 75/25 rule -&gt; Goal Clarity + Autonomy + Regular Feedback ]</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Life has several exits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The exit from your workplace. The last day of work for your employer or your company.</li>
  <li>The exit from that youth group that accompanied you through teenage years and early adulthood.</li>
  <li>The exit from your high-school.</li>
  <li>The exit from your hometown.</li>
  <li>The exit from a long term relationship.</li>
  <li>The exit from life. Your funeral.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon your exit, your contributions, actions, decisions, opinions and presence most likely will have affected the trajectories of the people and the world around you, in obvious and less obvious ways. Perhaps your own trajectory was deeply changed as well.</p>

<p>These exits may be celebrated, be a special day with fulfilling words and thoughts. They may be the last time you see a set of people. The last time you will see them in your entire life.</p>

<p>Perhaps upon your final exit, you have made such consequential dents on the world that your name will be engraved into the annals of history for centuries to come. On the other hand, contemporary personalities such Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Warren Buffet might be mostly forgotten a few centuries from now. People will move on, so most likely you should be grateful if your loved ones keep you in their thoughts for those ensuing decades.</p>

<p>Life has several exits. Life is also short and limited. There’ll be a finite number of exits you will experience. Make the most out of each period they enclose.</p>

    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/08/05/real_question_behind_what_you_want</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to want something. If you are fortunate enough to be on <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels/income-level-4/">income level 4</a> living in a peaceful nation, the world has so much to offer, within easy reach. Yet, the currencies required to enjoy them are limited: time, energy, health, money. Even though it is easy to make lists of everything one wants (typically occurring on yearly passages, such as new year’s and anniversaries), only a handful of them are achievable.</p>

<h2 id="smaller-lists-require-sacrifices">Smaller lists require sacrifices</h2>
<p>Given that lengthy lists are unachievable, they need to be slimmed down to a manageable and realistic size. They need to be prioritized. <em>Prioritization</em> is an euphemism for <em>sacrificing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to want something, it’s hard to choose it against another desirable one.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>At the start of each year, I produce a small list of 3 to 4 high priority goals and 1 optional low priority goal of what I want to achieve by end of it, along with a small description on why I want them, and their impact. This takes several hours, sometimes days to put together, because of all the other ones that need to be left out.</p>

<p>Once the list is made though, it’s incredibly powerful due to it’s easy recall. This means that whenever I am faced with conflicting preferences, I can easily remember it and know in a snap what is the right thing to do. That is the real power behind that list. It’s guiding all the tiny small steps and decisions happening throughout the year, bringing me progressivily closer to those goals.</p>

<h2 id="the-question">The question</h2>
<p>The real question behind defining <em>knowing what we want</em> is actually <em>what we are willing to sacrifice</em>. Once the latter is defined and we are 100% convinced about it, then <em>knowing what we want</em> is bullet proof and easy to follow through. </p>

<p>What are you willing to sacrifice?</p>

    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT triggered a remarkable societal and computational shift that feels comparable to the impact from the initial internet era with its first impressive search engines like Google. LLMs are the toast of the town.</p>

<p>Writing emails, reports, school homework, analysis, code, summaries. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Save from when you would delegate this task to another fellow human, long hours would be passed in the past trying to conjure a piece of text that could communicate something to another entity. Now this can be made at scale, at low cost, with low effort.</p>

<p>Since we are still liable for the results of this tool, i.e. it’s still our name on the email sender, instead of just sending that email, we might first read that LLM output, interpret it, understand it, and then send it.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-text">More than just text</h2>

<p>Text is a form of communication. If something, or someone wrote it for us, certain decisions were made along the way to convey the goal that we gave. Out of the many paths possible to crystallize that piece of knowledge into a piece text, one of them was chosen.</p>

<p>I would claim that something gets lost on that delegation.</p>

<p>The writing process is more than just the production of text. Many times it requires the exploration of different perspectives, thinking deeply and coming to terms that we don’t know enough about a subject and need to learn more about it.</p>

<p>For example, it’s essential for me to have a notebook at hand to take notes during meetings and formal discussions. I write phrases, loose words, make small diagrams, jot down some reminders. Some of them are never to be re-read again, others I revisit to structure them down into a concise structure. Most of all, they help me think about a problem.</p>

<p>Same holds for notes and articles. I start with a cloud of loosely related ideas, which I attempt to refine into a structured form. Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)">double diamond</a> process.</p>

<p>Same for books. Several times I’ve come to terms that I learned close to nothing about a book read one month before. Or conversations. Or movies. Or experiences.</p>

<p>This is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otazg3TuPWM">except</a> if I reflected or acted about them. Except if I wrote down my conclusions about them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, taking notes helps make sure that I’m really thinking hard about what’s in there. If I disagree with the book, sometimes it takes a long time to read the books because I’m writing so much in the margin</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.</p>

  <p><em>― Theophrastus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are countless articles, books, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4">videos</a> and lectures about time management. Since all of us have different needs, goals and environments, it is best to face them as guidances, where we take the ones we need, and leave the others in our toolbelt for another time.</p>

<p>One of these methodologies is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>, in which a kitchen timer is used to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. </p>

<p>This doesn’t work for me, so here is my <em>Custom Pomodoro Technique</em>.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>I usually need long bouts of deep focus during my work or any complex tasks. This can be reading / writing code, aligning with partners, structuring plans, going through my finances, etc. 25 minutes is typically not enough, since it coincides with where most of my flow peaks happen.</p>

<p>One hour is my target for continuous focused work. Below that, I know that I can still take advantage of the remaining time to productively go through a problem. Above that, I start to prepare to wind down and take a break.</p>

<p>Rule of thumb for breaks are to be enough to feel rested, which tends to happen in less than 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>I’ve tried several tools to track time. Physical and digital. Complex and simple. One has stuck for several years, and is the only one I use right now: <a href="https://www.klokki.com/">Klokki</a></p>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_full_dialog.webp" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog" />
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_full_dialog.png" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog" />
             <img src="https://lopespm.com/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_full_dialog.png" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki timer dialog" />
           </picture>
         </center>

<p>Klokki is a concise Mac application that tracks time and generates nice time reports. It also allows you to track your time automatically, but I don’t use that feature.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful tool that fulfills my main requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being able to start and stop the timer with a single click.</li>
  <li>The timer should be always visible, but also non-obtrusive.</li>
  <li>Simple usage, with a low UI footprint. No distractions.</li>
  <li>Concise time reports, which allow me to know how much time (and energy) I’ve used throughout the week. This is important for pacing calibration.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The rules</h2>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki on the toolbar, when started">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_on_1_minute.webp" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki on the toolbar, when started" />

           </picture>
         </center>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever I sit down at the computer and start working, I start the timer. <em>I converged into using a single category to track all my deep flow blocks, since having multiple categories created too much mental overhead</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever the timer is on, I’m in productivity / work mode, and no distractions outside my goals are allowed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refrain from stopping the flow session before the one hour mark. Start preparing to stop the flow session after the 1 hour mark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take breaks in-between flow sessions, until I feel rested. Normally less than 15 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the timer is off, scattered tasks, exploration and wandering are allowed and encouraged.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<center>
          <picture aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki on the toolbar, when stopped">
             <source type="image/webp" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_off.webp" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki on the toolbar, when stopped" />
             <source type="image/png" srcset="/files/custom_pomodoro/timer_off.png" aria-label="Screenshot of Klokki on the toolbar, when stopped" />

           </picture>
         </center>

<h2 id="the-benefits">The benefits</h2>

<p>This is an incredibly simple methodology that I’ve been using throughout the past years. The recurrent benefits I’ve captured from it were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear boundaries between focus time and exploration.</li>
  <li>Simple, easy to follow process, allowing for flexibility on how time blocks are managed. Easy to consistently abide by.</li>
  <li>Pacing: prevents over-working or under-utilization of my energy / time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to use this guidance / methodology and experiment with it, Or not 🙏</p>

    <updated>2023-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/05/18/solving-task-switching-through-documentation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We don’t actually multitask. We switch-task, rapidly shifting from one thing to another, interrupting ourselves unproductively, and losing time in the process <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It just so happens that many aspects of our life require managing multiple tasks at the same time, so how to approach it?</p>

<p>One strategy that consistently worked for me has been using documentation to checkpoint each step of a process. Just like in a videogame where the last saved checkpoint can be recalled.</p>

<h2 id="the-backtracking-inefficiency">The Backtracking Inefficiency</h2>

<p>Similar to a CPU, our short-term memory (STM) has access to a limited amount (around four or seven concepts have been suggested <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) of very quick memory. Everytime we change to a different task, most of the resident concepts need to be flushed in order to load the ones from the incoming task. This is quite taxing by itself and narrowly optimizable, since our wetware is mostly fixed. The biggest efficiency opportunities lie in <em>where</em> these concepts are loaded from.</p>

<p>When working on a task, often we grab several simultaneous concepts, combine them together and generate new ones, which are then added to the concept pool and built upon further. During this process we are faced with these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Option 1.</strong> Don’t store our working memory - essentially lose work. Let’s rule out this option.</li>
  <li><strong>Option 2.</strong> Progressively store the existing concepts into our long term memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Option 3.</strong> Progressively store the existing concepts into an external memory bank, such as a document or piece of paper.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 2.</strong> works well, but requires significant cognitive effort and often only keeps the most relevant conclusions. If for some reason these need to be re-considered or understood why they were generated in the first place, we backtrack into the seminal thought processes, which in turn will probably require a repetition of previous work.</p>

<p>This is one of the biggest offenders when task switching, because even if we recall the end state of a task (which is hard by itself), a lot of time and energy are spent when revisiting the overall context via backtracking.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-as-checkpoint-mechanism">Documentation as Checkpoint Mechanism</h2>

<p>Enter <strong>Option 3.</strong>: <em>Progressively store these existing concepts into an external memory bank, such as a document or piece of paper.</em> Although writing in an external memory bank the contents of our working memory can take some effort, the yielded results greatly justify the initial investment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less cognitive load upon re-starting a task</li>
  <li>Backtracking effort is reduced, since it is a matter of reading a document</li>
  <li>Shareable with other stakeholders, which shaves off the time required to explain these concepts</li>
  <li>Task switching becomes smoother and less burdensome</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The documentation’s structure significantly impacts how efficiently it can be parsed and shared. That is a whole new topic by itself.</li>
  <li>Documentation as a checkpointing mechanism is a great way to consolidate personal learnings and reflections. It’s a valuable tool for leveraging life’s experiences to mature and grow. <em><strong>Option 1.</strong> is such a waste.</em></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DavidSinclairPodcast">David Sinclair</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab">Andrew Hubberman</a> on how to extend lifespan or improve health markers, and a common trait emerges: the body strives and improves when exposed to just enough stress and struggle. Not too much, though. Cold baths, saunas, fasting, exercise, red light (which disrupts the way that our mitochondria make energy), eating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO8FJ8i02Xo">stressed greens</a>, are examples of just that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you spend your whole day sitting, or typing, always satisfying your hunger, your AMPK and mTOR pathways (which are master regulators of cell metabolism) and sirtuins say: <em>“Hey, times are good. Let’s just grow tissue, go forth, multiply and not build a sustainable body in the long run.”</em></p>

<p>The idolized unhurdled, stable and comfortable life, the easy access to resources and high caloric food, can do more harm than good when left unattended.</p>

<h2 id="the-riveting-third-person">The riveting third person</h2>

<p>I’ve consumed gargantuous amounts of television throughout my youth, so I’ve grown familiar with it’s charming alure. In an almost frictionless experience, where it suffices to lean back and pick one of the channels or series/movies/documentaries readily suggested by a streaming provider, an experience is entered where carefully crafted packages and passionate stories are delivered to us, requiring only our attention. It can even serve as the <em>third-person</em> to liven up the room, when in a tedious moment with a loved one.</p>

<p>No real struggle, no real effort required. A passive experience. The body rejoices in it, like it does when ingesting a sugar packed sweet. Just like most, I enjoy that feeling. Just like most, I have a limited amount of willpower. Hence why I don’t have a TV at home. Neither do I have sweets.</p>

<p>I love it. I don’t love the fact that I’m blocking myself away from those satisfactions. No, I relish the long term results. The time it opens up to actively read, write (this post for example), create, think, be present with others, and even watch podcasts (of which I make an effort to pick an episode outside the normal recommendations). I’m not perfect, and the above serves as a rule for me. And rules do have exceptions, and that’s ok. </p>

<p>Still, this is the case for not having a TV.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <em>Notes</em>!</p>

<p>This is a new space where you will be able to find essays, notes and other quick thoughts, whereas the existing <em>Blog</em> section will remain allocated to denser article pieces.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<h3 id="the-recurrent-idea">The Recurrent Idea</h3>

<p>I have a rule when buying non-essential items for my house: if I’ve been recurrently thinking about buying something over a span of multiple days, then it’s a good purchasing signal. The thought process for writing articles for this blog is similar.</p>

<p>The downside of this approach is that the ideas and thoughts that don’t make it to a blog article are relegated into the realm of personal writings and/or conversations with others, but never exposed to the public. On the other hand, this very same thirst to share quick thoughts was recurrent by itself.</p>

<h3 id="framing">Framing</h3>

<p>The yearning towards developing this concept was there, but a satisfactory hosting plaform was missing still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitter: although it allowed for volume and looser thoughts, the character restriction would limit the exploration of a topic, and all the content would not be owned by me.</li>
  <li>New self-hosted space: this allowed me to own the contents and have a clear separation between dense blog articles and quick thoughts, but the maintenance cost was prohibitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third option was to host them here, in <em>Byte Tank</em>, which was customized over several years and already had the workflow and components I strived for. But how to frame this new concept into the existing structure?</p>

<p>The answer came from <a href="https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/How%20I%20write%20this%20blog%20on%20my%20iPhone%20in%20a%20train">Alin Panaitiu</a>. On his website, Alin has a separate section for <em>Notes</em>, which makes perfect sense to me. <em>Notes</em> sets the expectation that they are not fully fledged articles, and that they cater towards volume, rather than density.</p>

<h3 id="making-it-a-reality">Making it a reality</h3>

<p>An idea is only worth for its implementation, and these were the last nudges that incentivized me to bring it to life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inspiring examples presented in several of the comments in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35164819">Ask HN: What has your personal website/blog done for you?</a>. One of them being a reference to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/">Why and how to write things on the Internet</a>, the other one being Alin’s website (see above).</li>
  <li>The spirit of the earlier Internet. I remember the earlier times of the Internet where there was this widespread fascination with the fact that with a telephone connection, one could have access to its immense world, and had the possibility to create their own virtual home, that anyone could visit. That is one of the many beauties of this massive network. Low cost, virtually no gatekeepers, nearly boundless. I find this idea incredibly exciting and empowering.</li>
  <li>Even in an era where text content is now produced for a low cost and in massive amounts (GPT and other LLMs), I believe there is still space for <em>artisanal</em> human baked opinions. The human relatableness, its connection with the environment, biology and even its limitations are still charming on their own.</li>
  <li>The incentive to create notes in volume could be a great way to generate more source material that can be coalesced into new blog articles</li>
  <li>Exposing looser thoughts publicly forces me to structure then, and I believe this process can make me better equipped to navigate the complex universe of human interactions, in which having a more structured mindset can make a world of a difference. Personally and professionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>

<p>This is an exciting new phase for this modest establishment, and I’m looking forward to populating this section with new content. Until then!</p>
